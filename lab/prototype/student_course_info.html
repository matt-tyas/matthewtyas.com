			<p>History of Photography students aim to reconstruct, understand and explain the past through the study of its practitioners, artefacts and images, using critical skills and insights particular to the historical profession or drawn from other related disciplines.</p>
	
			<p>The School of Photography, Film and Television is an internationally renowned research-led department with professorial staff leading research groups and the teaching of each of its three programmes of study. The School's programmes cover all major topics in depth with options allowing students to focus on both chronological and topic-based interests across the three year programme. Options to study abroad, including an established work-placement programme, are available in Europe, America and the Far East. 
	Leeds students have access to some of the best library resources in the country in particular the University's Brotherton Library houses one of Britain's largest historical research collections and is an invaluable resource for student research projects in years two and three. Students also have easy access from Campus to the British Library branch at Boston Spa and to the National Media Museum at Bradford.
	The School of Photography, Film and Television ensures its graduates develop advanced skills in critical thinking, information handling, research and all forms of communication, and as such they are highly sought after by leading employers in fields as diverse as Law, broadcasting, journalism and accountancy, as well as more subject orientated careers such as the heritage industry, archivism and teaching.</p>
	
			<h5>The programme will:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>equip students with extensive background and comparative historical knowledge of a number of chronological periods, technologies, media, genres, cultures or geographic regions;</li>
				<li>offer students a wide choice of specialist topics covering many periods, techniques and media, based on the research specialisms of staff in the School;</li>
				<li>equip students with a broad awareness of general developments in photography ranging across formats, genre, manufacture, process and people, as well as providing options to explore and develop in-depth knowledge of topics chosen by the student;</li>
				<li>enable students to gain an understanding of and practical skills in a range of photographic media, techniques and equipment from the earliest camera obscura, via calotype negatives and Polaroid instant film to ultra high resolution digital 3-D imaging;</li>
				<li>equip students with the skills and opportunity to conduct autonomous supervised research projects, including a primary source based dissertation;</li>
				<li>provide students with tools for the critical interpretation of both secondary and primary texts;</li>
				<li>expose students to a variety of the approaches and conceptual tools of some of the sub-disciplines of the historical profession, which may include social history, economic history, technological history and gender history;</li>
				<li>develop students' competency at communicating their ideas by a variety of methods, including oral presentations, photographic essays and a research-based dissertation.</li>
				<li>develop the knowledge, skills and aptitudes which make our graduates able to compete effectively and to progress in whatever area they move onto beyond their time at the University.</li>
