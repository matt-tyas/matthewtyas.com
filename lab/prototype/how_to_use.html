<h2>Website</h2>
<h3>Student dashboard</h3>
<p>Access to the Leeds for Life website is via the Portal, and all taught students can log in to view their personalised dashboard.</p>
<p>From here, they can see the development opportunities available through their school and explore the range of co-curricular opportunities. These opportunities can help them develop or enhance specific skills and range from volunteering and study abroad to membership of societies.<br>The student can choose the opportunities they are interested in, save them to their dashboard and any follow up actions or notes will be recorded and date-stamped.</p>
<p>The dashboard also holds personal tutorial webforms, and lists skills and learning outcomes relating to the student's individual programme. It is also packed with case studies from students, graduates and employers which contain first-hand advice on the importance of developing skills through co-curricular and academic activities.</p>
<h3>Living CV</h3>
<p>Students can access the living CV area of the website from their dashboard. It provides students with practical advice and information on how to develop their CV based on the opportunities they have saved from the Leeds for Life website. It is also a single point of access to the information they have recorded from personal tutoring sessions, exam marks across each year of study, their personal statement (the collection of reviews of each year) and it has the facility for each student to add links to other websites, such as job adverts.</p>
<h3>Staff dashboard</h3>
<p>When staff log in to the website, the information displayed on their dashboard varies depending on their role.</p>
<p>Personal tutors (and administrators responsible for personal tutoring) can access the information provided by their students through the webforms and personal statement. They also have online support such as guidance on how to use the webforms, examples of school handbooks and signposts to other useful information which may inform their personal tutorials.</p>
<p>Staff who are not involved in personal tutoring have access to general information about Leeds for Life and get advice on how they might use it in their interactions with students.</p>
