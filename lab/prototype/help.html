<h2>Leeds for life</h2>
<h3>Ethos</h3>
<p>Leeds for Life is about preparing our students for their future. It's about inspiring them to get the most out of their academic and co-curricular experiences and build on their time studying at the University of Leeds. We want our students to be able to recognise the value of everything they have done at university and be at ease articulating this clearly and confidently. </p>
<p>Effective induction has a vital role to play in smoothing the transition from school to university and helping new students to integrate effectively into our academic community so that they can get the maximum benefit from it. Integrating students into the academic community:  Examples of Good Practice" brings together existing successful practice as a resource for all schools.</p>
<p>At the heart of Leeds for Life is personal tutoring.  We established the Leeds model for personal tutoring to provide students with structured one to one meetings with their personal tutor. These meetings run throughout their degrees and focus on their professional, academic and wellbeing development, helping them become confident, articulate individuals.  An integral part of these meetings are personal tutoring webforms, which help students prepare for each personal tutorial through a list of reflective prompts. These forms ensure the tutor and student have a clear agenda for the meeting, helping them record the outcomes and plan for the next meeting. The forms are saved to the student's dashboard and can be referenced and updated at any time.</p>
<p>The form for the final meeting invites the student to reflect on the year and record anything significant which could be useful when developing their CV or when their personal tutor is writing their references.</p>

<h3>Student Ambassadors</h3>
<p>The <a href="Ambassadors.aspx">Leeds for Life Student Ambassadors</a> work with staff and students to promote Leeds for Life through their own programme of activities and at school-based events, meetings and committees.</p>
