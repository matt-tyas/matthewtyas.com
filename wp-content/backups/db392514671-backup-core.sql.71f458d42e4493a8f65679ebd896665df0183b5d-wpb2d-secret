I split my time between my day job, freelance work, running <a href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\">manchestersfinest.com</a> and <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/matt_tyas\">making music</a>. From time to time I also write my <a href=\"/out-of-my-head/\">blog</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>But it wasn\'t always so…</h2>\r\n\r\nBack in the eighties, my HTML was cardboard and my CSS, Sellotape. I just loved making things. Inventions and contraptions to solve my every problems. Problems such as:\r\n<blockquote>“How do I get a Malteser in my mouth without having to get out of bed or move any of my limbs?”</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis was how the, \'Tonka Truck Malteser Race Track Delivery Device ™\', or, \'TTMRTDD\', was born. I am currently in a legal battle with Apple over this one.\r\n\r\n<h2>The world\'s worst website</h2>\r\n\r\nWhen I was 13 I built a website. We had dial up Compuserve internet. It was called, \"Matthew Tyas\'s website\" (because I couldn\'t change the page title) and it consisted of a home page, and a contact page with nothing but a clip art email link that didn\'t work. In fact, none of the links worked. I managed, however, to upload one MS Paint image. It was a scrawl that said,\r\n<blockquote>“Welcome to the world\'s worst website”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do you want to employ me yet? Wait, I\'ve not finished!</h2>\r\n\r\nSince then I have continued to build websites and applications. At first badly (oh god, so badly) but I was lucky enough to meet some inspirational people who have helped me along the way and, I also put a lot of hours in to build up my skills.\r\n\r\n<h2>Full circle</h2>\r\n\r\nNowadays I plan projects with users and client requirements in mind. I wireframe through sketching, rubbing out, sketching, opening omnigraffle, drawing again, screwing up paper, asking for an opinion, wondering why I never thought of that, smiling, crying, smiling again, prototyping, testing, drawing some more and then, finally I\'m allowed to open Photoshop and apply some polish. Then it\'s client approval (yeah, I wish it was always that simple) build, test, build, device test, build, browser test, build, cry because of the errors and inconsistencies (feel like the king of the internet when you fix them), test, build and finally&hellip; launch. Always the best, and also the most anti-climactic feeling in the world, I\'m sure you\'ll agree.\r\n\r\n<h2>So that\'s me</h2>\r\n\r\nDownload my CV for the nitty gritty, check out my portfolio for the visual stuff and of course check out <a href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\" target=\"_blank\">manchestersfinest.com</a> (another plug &#8212; sorry).\r\n\r\n<div class=\"cv\">\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"download-cv\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-icon=\"&#x25bc;\" ><span>Download CV</span></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<em>Updated CV coming soon</em>', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '16-revision-48', '', '', '2012-10-13 19:23:39', '2012-10-13 19:23:39', '', '16', 'http://matthewtyas.com/16-revision-48/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

I am fairly happy and I think I will find the time to log my processes properly after I put it live and I\'ve got a bit of work uploaded. I will however use these preliminary pre-live posts as a means to style the blog further so I need some real content. Something I can get someone to sit down and read to make sure and the design elements are tied up, everything is styled and the blog has good readability and rhythm.\r\n\r\n<h2>Embarrassing Website&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\nI decided to create a new site the day I released I had become embarrassed to give out my <a href=\"http://www.cmdcreative.com\">old URL</a> anymore, not a good sign I agree. The site was tired design wise, not built with a modern approach and built on a CMS that did not do well, what I wanted it too. That coupled with the fact that the domain name had become free a while back and I had snapped it up with the intention of putting something new up anyway.\r\n\r\nIt has however been a very busy year what with starting a new job at <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk\">Leeds University</a> and launching my most ambitious side-project to date <a href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\">manchestersfinest.com</a>. Time to finally get down to work on this site never seemed like it was going to come, however in early November I simply couldn\'t stand it anymore and put a <a href=\"http://www.matthewtyas.com\">holding page up</a>. Before long I had a Wordpress install in my dev folder and before you know it I was actually get my hands dirty coding up my matt-tyas theme. So I have got the thing to nearly a finished point in about a month. When I say finished though the term is relatively loose. I have a long list of work still to do. What I have achieved thus far however.\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating the site structure</h2>\r\n\r\nI created pages for, \'Home\', \'About\', \'Services\' and, \'contact\'. Home is then set as the homepage and uses a custom template that pulls in the newest four portfolio pieces, an area with information on Mcrfinest and an area that pulls in the newest two blog posts. I only have one category for the blog, called, \'blog\', to categorise within the blog I will either simply use tags or, sub-categories of, \'blog\'. I am yet to decide this. For my portfolio I created a, \'Work\' category and subcategories to sit under it. The work category page is displayed using a custom category template and the sub categories are then sorted using some Jquery (filterable.js) which I extended slightly so my sub-category titles would change when the categories are sorted. It looks sweet, <a href=\"#\">check it out</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Mobile in Mind</h2>\r\n\r\nMy new web design term, just made it up. Although I\'m doubtful it will catch on. Why? Well rather than design for mobile first and work up to the larger screen resolutions (<a href=\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/\">as you are supposed to - see 320 and up here</a>) I decided as I was well aware of exactly what my content was and how I wanted it to be displayed I design and built this site with, \'mobile in mind\'. I also assumed there would be time constraints due to other work therefore I wanted a desktop site live first. Having a responsive site is very important to me but because of the time I have put into building the site in the first place the layout actually only needs some tweaks get it ready thanks to my skills (lulz) and thanks to the <a href=\"http://themble.com/bones/\">Bones Wordpress developer theme</a> I chose to lay the foundations of my code (that is for another in depth blog, as are the responsive design elements of the site really). Anyway my decision to go this route will be tested in the coming weeks so let\'s see if I made a mistake or not!\r\n\r\n<h2>Plenty left to do</h2>\r\n\r\nI still do have a lot to do then. The site is only tested fully in Webkit and Firefox and needs mobile tweaks. I am not fully happy with the design of the inner pages (I am designing this in the browser as well, once again - another blog) and I need to come up with content for the, \'About\', \'Services\' and populate the, \'Work\' section. It\'s all fun though.\r\n\r\nIt is however my birthday today so you will forgive me if I cut this short now. \r\n\r\nBye.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Almost a new home', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'almost-a-new-home', '', '', '2011-12-26 17:06:25', '2011-12-26 17:06:25', '', '0', 'http://matthewtyas.com/lab/matthewtyas/?p=120', '0', 'post', '', '0'),

The site was tired design wise, not built with a modern approach and built on a CMS that did not do well, what I wanted it too.

Time to finally get down to work on this site never seemed like it was going to come, however in early November I simply couldn\'t stand it anymore and put a <a href=\"http://www.matthewtyas.com\">holding page up</a>.

What I have achieved thus far however.\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating the site structure</h2>\r\n\r\nI created pages for, \'Home\', \'About\', \'Services\' and, \'contact\'. Home is then set as the homepage and uses a custom template that pulls in the newest four portfolio pieces, an area with information on Mcrfinest, and an area that pulls in the newest two blog posts. I only have one category for the blog, called, \'blog\', to categorise with in the blog I will either simply use tags or, sub-categories of, \'blog\'. I am yet to decide this. For my portfolio I created a, \'Work\' category and subcategories to sit under it. The work category page is displayed using a custom category template and the sub categories are then sorted using some Jquery (filterable.js) which I extended slightly so my sub-category titles would change when the categories are sorted. It looks sweet, <a href=\"#\">check it out</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Mobile in Mind</h2>\r\n\r\nMy new web design term, just made it up. Although I\'m doubtful it will catch on. Why? Well rather than design for mobile first and work up to the larger screen resolutions (<a href=\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/\">as you are supposed to - see 320 and up here</a>) I decided as I was well aware of exactly what my content was and how I wanted it to be displayed I design and built this site with, \'mobile in mind\'. I also assumed there would be time constraints due to other work therefore I wanted a desktop site live first. Having a responsive site is very important to me but because of the time I have put into building the site in the first place the layout actually only needs some tweaks get it ready thanks to my skills (lulz) and thanks to the <a href=\"http://themble.com/bones/\">Bones Wordpress developer theme</a> I chose to lay the foundations of my code (that is for another in depth blog, as are the responsive design elements of the site really).

The site is only tested fully in Webkit and Firefox and needs mobile tweaks. I am not fully happy with the design of the inner pages (I am designing this in the browser as well, once again - another blog) and I need to come up with content for the, \'About\', \'Services\' and populate the, \'Work\' section.

('156', '1', '2011-12-16 10:10:11', '2011-12-16 10:10:11', 'My new site, at the time of writing this (although still in development) is all but complete. I am fairly happy and I think I will find the time to log my processes properly after I put it live and I\'ve got a bit of work uploaded. I will however use these preliminary pre-live posts as a means to style the blog further so I need some real content. Something I can get someone to sit down and read to make sure and the design elements are tied up, everything is styled and the blog has good readability and rhythm.\r\n\r\n<h2>Embarrassing Website&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\nI decided to create a new site the day I released I had become embarrassed to give out my <a href=\"http://www.cmdcreative.com\">old URL</a> anymore, not a good sign I agree. The site was tired design wise, not built with a modern approach and built on a CMS that did not do well, what I wanted it too. That coupled with the fact that the domain name had become free a while back and I had snapped it up with the intention of putting something new up anyway.\r\n\r\nIt has however been a very busy year what with starting a new job at <a href=\"http://www.leeds.ac.uk\">Leeds University</a> and launching my most ambitious side-project to date <a href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\">manchestersfinest.com</a>. Time to finally get down to work on this site never seemed like it was going to come, however in early November I simply couldn\'t stand it anymore and put a <a href=\"http://www.matthewtyas.com\">holding page up</a>. Before long I had a Wordpress install in my dev folder and before you know it I was actually get my hands dirty coding up my matt-tyas theme. So I have got the thing to nearly a finished point in about a month. When I say finished though the term is relatively loose. I have a long list of work still to do. What I have achieved thus far however.\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating the site structure</h2>\r\n\r\nI created pages for, \'Home\', \'About\', \'Services\' and, \'contact\'. Home is then set as the homepage and uses a custom template that pulls in the newest four portfolio pieces, an area with information on Mcrfinest and an area that pulls in the newest two blog posts. I only have one category for the blog, called, \'blog\', to categorise within the blog I will either simply use tags or, sub-categories of, \'blog\'. I am yet to decide this. For my portfolio I created a, \'Work\' category and subcategories to sit under it. The work category page is displayed using a custom category template and the sub categories are then sorted using some Jquery (filterable.js) which I extended slightly so my sub-category titles would change when the categories are sorted. It looks sweet, <a href=\"#\">check it out</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Mobile in Mind</h2>\r\n\r\nMy new web design term, just made it up. Although I\'m doubtful it will catch on. Why? Well rather than design for mobile first and work up to the larger screen resolutions (<a href=\"http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/\">as you are supposed to - see 320 and up here</a>) I decided as I was well aware of exactly what my content was and how I wanted it to be displayed I design and built this site with, \'mobile in mind\'. I also assumed there would be time constraints due to other work therefore I wanted a desktop site live first. Having a responsive site is very important to me but because of the time I have put into building the site in the first place the layout actually only needs some tweaks get it ready thanks to my skills (lulz) and thanks to the <a href=\"http://themble.com/bones/\">Bones Wordpress developer theme</a> I chose to lay the foundations of my code (that is for another in depth blog, as are the responsive design elements of the site really). Anyway my decision to go this route will be tested in the coming weeks so let\'s see if I made a mistake or not!\r\n\r\n<h2>Plenty left to do</h2>\r\n\r\nI still do have a lot to do then. The site is only tested fully in Webkit and Firefox and needs mobile tweaks. I am not fully happy with the design of the inner pages (I am designing this in the browser as well, once again - another blog) and I need to come up with content for the, \'About\', \'Services\' and populate the, \'Work\' section. It\'s all fun though.\r\n\r\nIt is however my birthday today so you will forgive me if I cut this short now. \r\n\r\nBye.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Almost a new home', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '120-revision-18', '', '', '2011-12-16 10:10:11', '2011-12-16 10:10:11', '', '120', 'http://matthewtyas.com/lab/matthewtyas/?p=156', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

It really has been an exciting side project to be a part of and nice to build a high traffic site that I did not hand off to a client and never see again.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say I think that we have a solid user base, around 12,000 hits a month with peaks of up to 16,000 and, as we approach our first year live, it is time to look forward to how I hope to improve the site over the next year.\r\n<h2>The Year Ahead</h2>\r\nLess Plugins, Leaner Mark-up.\r\n\r\nIn the next year I hope to reduce the site\'s reliance on plugin\'s and clean up the code. This is such a short sentence, but such a huge job. When I developed the site there were areas I could not develop alone without the aid of plugins. With the knowledge I have acquired over the last year it may now be possible to remove some of the plugins that I feel we could do without and hopefully improve the front-end mark-up to improve performance within the site.\r\n<h2>A Mobile Strategy</h2>\r\nI kick myself daily about not building in mobile support from the start. This has to be tackled. Finest\'s strength is it\'s ability to give people fresh ideas about where to go, what to see, and what to do in Manchester. As you can see from the <a title=\"Manchesters Finest Mobile App\" href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/manchesters-finest-mobile-app/\" target=\"_blank\">mobile app I designed a while ago</a> a mobile version of the site (or a responsive version, as I would have gone with originally) would give users the flexibility to use the site on the go on small devices.\r\n<h2>This as an opportunity</h2>\r\nIf I can\'t easily build responsive features in to the site now then maybe we do look at something like the App mentioned above. We can then give users something the site does not - the ability to select what they want (eating, drinking, shops etc) while on the go in Manchester then be served reviews, directions and whatever other meta data we can pull from our database that we think is useful. The amount of times I have been in a city wanting to know where the cool places to go are, not just the chains that fill city centres.\r\n\r\nIt\'s certainly a lot to think about, and I need to make friends with an App developer, any takers?', 'Manchester\'s Finest review of the year', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '298-revision-25', '', '', '2012-01-11 17:40:03', '2012-01-11 17:40:03', '', '298', 'http://matthewtyas.com/298-revision-25/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

I am currently in a legal battle with Apple over this one.\r\n<h2>The world\'s worst website</h2>\r\nWhen I was 13 I built a website. We had dial up Compuserve internet. It was called, \"Matthew Tyas\'s website\" (because I couldn\'t change the page title) and it consisted of a home page, and a contact page with nothing but a clip art email link that didn\'t work. In fact, none of the links worked. I managed, however, to upload one MS Paint image. It was a scrawl that said,\r\n<blockquote>“Welcome to the world\'s worst website”</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Do you want to employ me yet? Wait, I\'ve not finished!</h2>\r\nI forgot about the web for a while and concentrated on graphic design (back then I didn\'t really associate much of what I saw on the internet with design anyway…) but later at <a href=\"http://www2.mmu.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, whilst studying <a href=\"http://www.designandartdirection.mmu.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Design &amp; Art Direction</a> I started to notice interactions, and user experience on web sites. At this point I started to realise that designing for the web was a type of design in itself. Design that needed to flex, grow and accomodate multiple situations and multiple use cases.\r\n\r\nFrom then on it was a dash to learn everything I could about web design, coding and UX.\r\n<h2>Today, this type of design still excites me the most.</h2>\r\nEvery time I approach a new project there are new techniques to implement.

We get 30,000 plus visitors a month, and have a weekly newsletter and twitter account with over 10,000 subscribers each. We look to constantly review, improve and promote the site. Over the last six months I have improved the coding, introduced a mobile view and automated the sending of the \r\nnewsletter, as well as focusing on new user groups (such as the student population) and recruited new young writers to keep our content fresh and relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Focus on simplicity</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Since launch the site has only had minor tweaks to the layout (mainly to free up some advertising space in the header) and to try give better prominence and more control over some of the content on the homepage.

('500', '1', '2012-10-17 20:05:36', '2012-10-17 20:05:36', '<em>I recently wrote a justification for some design decisions I made whilst designing our team web site at work. The article below deals with bending web guidelines to allow the use of new techniques. I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also. It was written primarily for an audience within marketing and management. It is where possible, none technical.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\" alt=\"Web solutions desktop web site layout image\" title=\"desktop\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - desktop.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\" alt=\"Web solutions tablet size web site layout image\" title=\"tablet\" width=\"468\" height=\"426\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - tablet.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\" alt=\"Web solutions mobile size web site layout image\" title=\"mobile\" width=\"314\" height=\"528\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - mobile.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\" alt=\"Alternate Leeds University masthead layouts\" title=\"masthead-mobile-alt\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Two examples of how the logo format may have to change at smaller sizes. No guidleines exist for small screens but these rough examples still break branding guidelines with regards to the logo, badly.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n										\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\" alt=\"Web solutions next to the corporate website image\" title=\"corporate\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>I feel the Web Solutions site, sits well within the corporate family.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\r\n					\r\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace Vs Web Guidelines', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'keeping-pace-vs-web-guidelines', '', '', '2012-10-25 14:44:31', '2012-10-25 14:44:31', '', '0', 'http://matthewtyas.com/?p=500', '0', 'post', '', '0'),

We needed it to do four things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\n					\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\n\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\n\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\n\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\n\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\n\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\n\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\n\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\n\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\n				\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\n\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\n\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\n\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\n\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\n\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\n					\n					\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\n					\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\n					\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\n					\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\n					\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\n					\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\n					\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\n					\n\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\n					\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace - Web Guidelines', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '500-revision-4', '', '', '2012-05-30 06:42:09', '2012-05-30 06:42:09', '', '500', 'http://matthewtyas.com/500-revision-4/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation.

The article below deals with bending web guidelines to allow the use of new techniques. I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_511\" align=\"alignnone\" caption=\"Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.\"]<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead.

The article below deals with bending web guidelines to allow the use of new techniques. I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_511\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"660\" caption=\"Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.\"]<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n					\r\n					\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n					\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site.

In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_511\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"660\" caption=\"Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.\"]<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" width=\"660\" height=\"105\" class=\"size-full wp-image-511\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n					\r\n					\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n					\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\r\n					\r\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace - Web Guidelines', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '500-revision-12', '', '', '2012-05-30 06:49:57', '2012-05-30 06:49:57', '', '500', 'http://matthewtyas.com/500-revision-12/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

The article below deals with bending web guidelines to allow the use of new techniques. I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines.

The article below deals with bending web guidelines to allow the use of new techniques. I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"Current masthead title and UoL logo on small screen\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n					\r\n					\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users.

We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-510\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n					\r\n					\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n					\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site.

The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\" alt=\"Web solutions desktop web site layout image\" title=\"desktop\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - desktop.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n					\r\n					\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n					\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\r\n					\r\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace Vs Web Guidelines', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '500-revision-23', '', '', '2012-05-30 06:59:38', '2012-05-30 06:59:38', '', '500', 'http://matthewtyas.com/500-revision-23/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\" alt=\"Web solutions desktop web site layout image\" title=\"desktop\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - desktop.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\" alt=\"Web solutions tablet size web site layout image\" title=\"tablet\" width=\"468\" height=\"426\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - tablet.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\" alt=\"Web solutions mobile size web site layout image\" title=\"mobile\" width=\"314\" height=\"528\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - mobile.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\" alt=\"Alternate Leeds University masthead layouts\" title=\"masthead-mobile-alt\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Two examples of how the logo format may have to change at smaller sizes. No guidleines exist for small screens but these rough examples still break branding guidelines with regards to the logo, badly.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n										\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\" alt=\"Web solutions next to the corporate website image\" title=\"corporate\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>I feel the Web Solutions site, sits well within the corporate family.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\r\n					\r\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace Vs Web Guidelines', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '500-revision-26', '', '', '2012-05-30 07:06:51', '2012-05-30 07:06:51', '', '500', 'http://matthewtyas.com/500-revision-26/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

We needed it to do four things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\n					\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\n\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\n\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\n\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\n\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\n\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space.

I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space.

('702', '1', '2012-05-30 20:21:09', '2012-05-30 20:21:09', '<em>I recently wrote a justification for some design decisions I made whilst designing our team web site at work. The article below deals with bending web guidelines to allow the use of new techniques. I deal mainly with responsive design here but, I also touch upon the use of @font-face and icon fonts also. It was written primarily for an audience within marketing and management. It is where possible, none technical.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing a Portfolio for the Web Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Our Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The remit for the site was fairly simple. We needed it to do four things:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Explain in simple terms the way we work with clients to produce web sites and applications</li>\r\n	<li>Showcase our design and development work</li>\r\n	<li>Introduce users to our CMS system</li>\r\n	<li>Give the web team a fun and approachable feel</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I put pencil to paper and quickly realised our requirements extended beyond the content and look and feel of the site. As the web team we have responsibility to stay up to date with recent trends and technologies. The web moves fast and so must we, or we are not doing our jobs properly.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h3>Why it is Beta</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind I came up with a few extra requirements. Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\r\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\r\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\" alt=\"Web solutions desktop web site layout image\" title=\"desktop\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - desktop.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n				\r\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\" alt=\"Web solutions tablet size web site layout image\" title=\"tablet\" width=\"468\" height=\"426\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - tablet.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\" alt=\"Web solutions mobile size web site layout image\" title=\"mobile\" width=\"314\" height=\"528\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - mobile.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\" alt=\"Alternate Leeds University masthead layouts\" title=\"masthead-mobile-alt\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>Two examples of how the logo format may have to change at smaller sizes. No guidleines exist for small screens but these rough examples still break branding guidelines with regards to the logo, badly.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n										\r\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\r\n					\r\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\r\n					\r\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\" alt=\"Web solutions next to the corporate website image\" title=\"corporate\" /></a>\r\n<figcaption>I feel the Web Solutions site, sits well within the corporate family.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\r\n					\r\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace Vs Web Guidelines', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '500-revision-30', '', '', '2012-05-30 20:21:09', '2012-05-30 20:21:09', '', '500', 'http://matthewtyas.com/500-revision-30/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

Requirements that ultimately cause this site to be defined as Beta, within the context of the University.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>What about mobile devices?</li>\n	<li>What about web fonts (@font-face)?</li>\n	<li>What about icon fonts?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Guidelines for the Good</h3>\n\n<p>As with any large organisation we have guidelines for how we work with design for print and web. These guidelines are a good way for the University to keep consistent branding across all of its design work, whether produced internally or externally.</p>\n\n<h3>Technology Moves Faster than our Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>Technology changes, user behaviour changes, and it is important to adapt as quickly as possible to ensure the best possible experience for clients and customers. One example of this over the last five years has been the rise in mobile browsing. Browser manufacturers, developers and designers have seen the need for sites to adapt to better serve content to a bigger or smaller screen. I am not going to go in to how this works or when, when not, or to what degree it should be implemented. I will however say, that browsing on devices of different sizes and abilities (on a 3G network for example) is a different experience and, should be treated as such. Guidelines on the other hand are not rewritten quickly enough to reflect this changing landscape. They have to carefully crafted, agreed and communicated to the wider audience. This takes time, time that the web does not respect.</p>\n\n<h3>My Way or the Guideline Way</h3>\n\n<p>I had to bend the guidelines. I decided to employ responsive techniques to make the content look as if it were designed specifically for whatever screen size you choose to view it on. In our case this was a standard desktop size of 960px down to a smart phone size of 320px. The content would shrink or stack based on a set of rules I would write in the code. As I started to design the navigation it became obvious I would have to bend the guidelines to fit the masthead in properly at all sizes. The current guidelines dictate the header of any University must appear as below, with navigation items under the page title and logo.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead.png\" alt=\"Current masthead\" title=\"masthead\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Masthead as featured in the current guidelines.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>On a smaller screen the page title and the logo would begin to touch. I could drop the page title under the logo, but if the title was long, and with the format of the UoL logo, users on a small screen would loose a lot of space at the top of their browser. Add on some navigation under this banner and most if not all of the screen, is gone before any useful page content can be seen.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"masthead-mobile\" width=\"315\" height=\"257\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Current masthead title and UoL logo begin to clash as smaller sizes, and we loose screen space. Add navigation as well and the issue gets worse.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>An Imperfect Solution</h3>\n\n<h4>Desktop</h4>\n\n<p>I began by bending the guidelines and placed the navigation along side the logo aligned left within the masthead. I replaced the standard, \'Home\', link with our name, \'Web Solutions\' which fulfilled the need to identify who within the University we are whilst saving some screen space. While this works well for our site, it would not translate to a site with a large title. I was starting to find a solution for our site, but not the wider institution.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/desktop.png\" alt=\"Web solutions desktop web site layout image\" title=\"desktop\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - desktop.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n				\n<h4>Tablet</h4>\n\n<p>As you approach tablet size the logo started the touch the navigation. I reformatted it into two columns of three links left aligned. This kept the navigation separated from the logo and thus retained the integrity of the design (resize the browser to see the effect).</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tablet.png\" alt=\"Web solutions tablet size web site layout image\" title=\"tablet\" width=\"468\" height=\"426\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - tablet.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h4>Mobile</h4>\n\n<p>As we get to mobile size the navigation is forced to drop under the logo, it still however stacks in two columns of three. The site title being part of the navigation however, helps to save real estate on the screen. The navigation items are now in rounded rectangles to define the button shape and they have a nice large area for fingers to press easily. The content slider below also has had its navigation changed from small dots to big left and right arrow buttons.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mobile.png\" alt=\"Web solutions mobile size web site layout image\" title=\"mobile\" width=\"314\" height=\"528\" class=\"normal-image\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Web Solutions - mobile.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>You keep saying you bent the Guidelines, you broke them?!</h3>\n\n<p>I am referring to having bent them as opposed to broke because I could have gone a lot further. For example the UoL logo. We had discussions in the office about the possibility of dropping the tower image off the logo at the smallest sizes. Leaving just the text portion, thus saving a lot of space in the top left of the screen. This was I believed a step too far however, without consulting the wider audience first.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/masthead-mobile-alt.png\" alt=\"Alternate Leeds University masthead layouts\" title=\"masthead-mobile-alt\" /></a>\n<figcaption>Two examples of how the logo format may have to change at smaller sizes. No guidleines exist for small screens but these rough examples still break branding guidelines with regards to the logo, badly.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n										\n<h3>Other Enhancements</h3>\n					\n<h4>Web Fonts</h4>\n					\n<p>When the guidelines were written we lived in the era of the, \'web safe font\'. There were only a handful of fonts you could safely use on a site to ensure your design was consistent for all users. Now due to font embedding and services such as <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a> and <a href=\"http://fontdeck.com/\">Font Deck</a> we have a whole world of new fonts available to us. I opted to use Meta Serif for my headings to give the design a friendly feel, and Droid Sans (designed specifically for readability on screens at small sizes) for smaller text. These decisions may not fully fit in with the guidelines at present, but to create a solution that worked for us I felt they were decisions worth taking.</p>\n					\n<h4>Icon Fonts</h4>\n					\n<p>Icons are a useful tool for designers, as humans are visual an icon can help user understand the information in front of them a bit quicker and sometimes without the need of text at all. However with the introduction of retina (very high resolution) screens. Images and icons look fuzzy (on retina screens) or when zoomed in into. Using a web font that displays all your icons means they stay sharp at any size, on any screen and, reduce the size of the page as they do not require extra image files.</p>\n					\n<h4>A Nod to Corporate</h4>\n					\n<p>I may have bent or broken our old guidelines slightly to achieve a design that worked for our team\'s needs but at all times I had one eye on the corporate style. I think the site manages to push forward slightly what we at the University need to be doing with the web but also, stays true to the strong corporate style and branding.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\"><img src=\"http://matthewtyas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/corporate.png\" alt=\"Web solutions next to the corporate website image\" title=\"corporate\" /></a>\n<figcaption>I feel the Web Solutions site, sits well within the corporate family.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Nothing I have done here is perfect, nor is it meant to be. The techniques employed in this site are only a few years old at most, and in the context of the University are fairly cutting edge. I have not solved the masthead issue only performed an experiment that may yet feed into the solution for a responsive masthead that works across more than just one site. It is important that a personal or team site is seen in some respects as a playground and a showcase of what could happen in the future to keep us excited about our work and what we can do, to help the University push forward is digital strategy in the future.</p>\n					\n<p class=\"smallprint\">Matt Tyas, Web Designer - ISS Web Solutions.</p>', 'Keeping Pace Vs Web Guidelines', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '500-revision-31', '', '', '2012-10-17 22:05:02', '2012-10-17 22:05:02', '', '500', 'http://matthewtyas.com/500-revision-31/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

I split my time between my day job, freelance work, running <a href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\">manchestersfinest.com</a> and <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/matt_tyas\">making music</a>. From time to time I also write my <a href=\"/out-of-my-head/\">blog</a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>But it wasn\'t always so…</h2>\r\n\r\nBack in the eighties, my HTML was cardboard and my CSS, Sellotape. I just loved making things. Inventions and contraptions to solve my every problems. Problems such as:\r\n<blockquote>“How do I get a Malteser in my mouth without having to get out of bed or move any of my limbs?”</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis was how the, \'Tonka Truck Malteser Race Track Delivery Device ™\', or, \'TTMRTDD\', was born. I am currently in a legal battle with Apple over this one.\r\n\r\n<h2>The world\'s worst website</h2>\r\n\r\nWhen I was 13 I built a website. We had dial up Compuserve internet. It was called, \"Matthew Tyas\'s website\" (because I couldn\'t change the page title) and it consisted of a home page, and a contact page with nothing but a clip art email link that didn\'t work. In fact, none of the links worked. I managed, however, to upload one MS Paint image. It was a scrawl that said,\r\n<blockquote>“Welcome to the world\'s worst website”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do you want to employ me yet? Wait, I\'ve not finished!</h2>\r\n\r\nSince then I have continued to build websites and applications. At first badly (oh god, so badly) but I was lucky enough to meet some inspirational people who have helped me along the way and, I also put a lot of hours in to build up my skills.\r\n\r\n<h2>Full circle</h2>\r\n\r\nNowadays I plan projects with users and client requirements in mind. I wireframe through sketching, rubbing out, sketching, opening omnigraffle, drawing again, screwing up paper, asking for an opinion, wondering why I never thought of that, smiling, crying, smiling again, prototyping, testing, drawing some more and then, finally I\'m allowed to open Photoshop and apply some polish. Then it\'s client approval (yeah, I wish it was always that simple) build, test, build, device test, build, browser test, build, cry because of the errors and inconsistencies (feel like the king of the internet when you fix them), test, build and finally&hellip; launch. Always the best, and also the most anti-climactic feeling in the world, I\'m sure you\'ll agree.\r\n\r\n<h2>So that\'s me</h2>\r\n\r\nDownload my CV for the nitty gritty, check out my portfolio for the visual stuff and of course check out <a href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\" target=\"_blank\">manchestersfinest.com</a> (another plug &#8212; sorry).\r\n\r\n', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '16-revision-49', '', '', '2012-10-14 15:51:54', '2012-10-14 15:51:54', '', '16', 'http://matthewtyas.com/16-revision-49/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

('788', '1', '2013-01-16 11:25:14', '2013-01-16 11:25:14', '<p>Quite a mouthfull but pretty much exactly what I googled when trying to solve this problem for a client recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<em>I will not in this article, be debating on whether having a full screen background video is a good or bad thing for users. I simply had a problem to solve.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>The problem</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The client (the PR for a band) wanted their design overlaid on a full screen video (a twenty second b/w loop). The site also had to be responsive. In a meeting it was mentioned that the site needed to be built using HTML 5, \"so the video will play on iPhone and iPad\".</p> \r\n\r\n<h3>Alarm bells</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>IOS touch devices (I am not sure on other devices at time of writing) will display a large play control in the centre of the video (in the case of this design therefore, right under the body copy) and if tapped the video will be played in the device\'s native player full screen thus rendering the site unusable. Therefore, clicking any link in the page is probably going to play the video and the user is going to be uncomfortably and unexpectedly shifted from the site to the video. Not even a useful video, a loop intended to give atmosphere to the design. Not to be viewed as a standalone piece of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to do?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly I knocked up a quick test of what I explained above to show the client. I took their video, added position absolute to it and made it width and height 100%. Then I relatively positioned some content over the top. In a browser, not bad. On a mobile (my iPhone 5) the expected result. The client agreed this was not acceptable. Now, I could build a separate mobile site, as some people have (<a href=\"http://www.whitelies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">whitelies.com</a> and <a href=\"http://m.whitelies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">m.whitelies.com/</a>). but they did not want two sites to update, and I did not have budget to build two either.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What now?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, flash was out (for obvious reasons) and they were dead set on the video being present where possible. I could easily use media queries to set an image at small screen sizes and work mobile first to introduce the video at an appropriate breakpoint. That however, does not work well at all. For example my 11\" Macbook Air is approximately the same size as a landscape iPad. I want the video on the Air but I want a fallback image on the Ipad&#8230;</p>\r\n\r\n<em>Given the length of the clip I even tried an animated gif, but at 20mb I was pushing it to say the least!</em>\r\n\r\n<p>After a bit of googling I realised I could use (Modernizr.touch) to at least serve an image based on whether the device was touch enabled instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nif (Modernizr.touch){\r\n   // Show the image please\r\n} else {\r\n   // Play the video, thank you Sir\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This still feels like sniffing really, and is not perfect by any means either. What will happen on a Microsoft surface&#8230;?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>After a bit more googling&#8230;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally I found the answer once I got on the Modernizr route and my searching took me too BigVideo.js which has a function using Modernizr touch to do exactly what I wanted (<a href=\"http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ambient-touch.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ambient-touch.html</a>). After <a href=\"https://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/issues/24\" target=\"_blank\">a bit of wrangling on Github</a> the demo was working and I was able to use the plugin to do exactly what I needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The bigger picture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This has been an interesting problem that is not really solved. I believe under the circumstances I have used the best solution possible. If you have a better one, <a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/contact/\" title=\"Contact\" target=\"_blank\">please get in touch</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The reason this is interesting is that the way we use devices is in a constant state of flux so the way manufacturers design them is also. In this case touch is not a good enough reason to not serve a video to a device. I am making assumptions about the devices usage.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I am having to assume that they are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All \'mobile\', and therefore may have slow connections or data usage limits</li>\r\n<li>All have the same default behaviour with video as IOS touch devices</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, this is not always true, touch screen desktops and laptop/tablet hybrids all exist. Some  are used both at home and away from home. Some may have default behaviour that limits our ability to do something and some don\'t. How can we as designers and developers provide as rich an experience as possible without knowing everything about a user, their device and environment, serving a fallback here and not there based on multiple users, devices and use cases?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A line in the sand</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is we can\'t. We have to use our experience and knowledge, talk to our steak holders and users (if possible) and draw a line in the sand.</p>', 'Background video with image fallback image for touch', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'html-5-background-video-with-image-fallback-image-for-touch', '', '\nhttp://matthewtyas.com/contact/', '2013-01-16 12:29:55', '2013-01-16 12:29:55', '', '0', 'http://matthewtyas.com/?p=788', '0', 'post', '', '0');

I want the video on the Air but I want a fallback image on the Ipad&#8230;</p>\r\n\r\n<em>Given the length of the clip I even tried an animated gif, but at 20mb I was pushing it to say the least!</em>\r\n\r\n<p>After a bit of googling I realised I could use (Modernizr.touch) to at least serve an image based on whether the device was touch enabled instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nif (Modernizr.touch){\r\n   // bind to touchstart, touchmove, etc and watch `event.streamId`\r\n} else {\r\n   // bind to normal click, mousemove, etc\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This still feels like sniffing really, and is not perfect by any means either. What will happen on a Microsoft surface&#8230;?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>After a bit more googling&#8230;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally I found the answer once I got on the Modernizr route and my searching took me too BigVideo.js which has a function using Modernizr touch to do exactly what I wanted (<a href=\"http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ambient-touch.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://dfcb.github.com/BigVideo.js/example-ambient-touch.html</a>). After <a href=\"https://github.com/dfcb/BigVideo.js/issues/24\" target=\"_blank\">a bit of wrangling on Github</a> the demo was working and I was able to use the plugin to do exactly what I needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The bigger picture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This has been an interesting problem that is not really solved. I believe under the circumstances I have used the best solution possible. If you have a better one, <a href=\"http://matthewtyas.com/contact/\" title=\"Contact\" target=\"_blank\">please get in touch</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The reason this is interesting is that the way we use devices is in a constant state of flux so the way manufacturers design them is also. In this case touch is not a good enough reason to not serve a video to a device. I am making assumptions about these device\'s usage.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I am having to assume that they are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>All \'mobile\', and therefore may have slow connections or data usage limits</li>\r\n<li>All have the same default behaviour with video as IOS touch devices</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, this is not always true, touch screen desktops and laptop/tablet hybrids all exist. Some  are used both at home and away from home. Some may have default behaviour that limits our ability to do something and some don\'t. How can we as designers and developers provide as rich an experience as possible without knowing everything about a user, their device and environment, serving a fallback here and not there based on multiple users, devices and use cases?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A line in the sand</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is we can\'t. We have to use our experience and knowledge, talk to our steak holders and users (if possible) and draw a line in the sand.</p>', 'Background video with image fallback image for touch', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '788-revision-17', '', '', '2013-01-16 12:27:18', '2013-01-16 12:27:18', '', '788', 'http://matthewtyas.com/788-revision-17/', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

We get 30,000 plus visitors a month, and have a weekly newsletter and twitter account with over 6,000 subscribers each. We look to constantly review, improve and promote the site. Over the last six months I have improved the coding, introduced a mobile view and automated the sending of the \r\nnewsletter, as well as focusing on new user groups (such as the student population) and recruited new young writers to keep our content fresh and relevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Focus on simplicity</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Since launch the site has only had minor tweaks to the layout (mainly to free up some advertising space in the header) and to try give better prominence and more control over some of the content on the homepage. The idea was that the simpler the better would be the best approach and this has paid off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Technical</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Finest has good old Wordpress handling the backend and a quite a few plugins (many that I have customised) to add functionality.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<aside class=\"g one-third\">\r\n\r\n<a class=\"btn\" href=\"http://www.manchestersfinest.com\" target=\"_blank\">manchestersfinest.com</a>\r\n\r\n</aside>', 'Manchester\'s Finest', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '414-revision-8', '', '', '2013-01-16 09:28:11', '2013-01-16 09:28:11', '', '414', 'http://matthewtyas.com/414-revision-8/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

There\'s a lot of outcry about some parts of this, with people saying they don\'t want \"personalized\" results. I actually think that normal users <em>do</em> want personalized results and that this is, for the most part, a good thing.</p><p>There\'s been some outcry though, because Twitter and Facebook aren\'t \"highlighted\" as much as Google+ in those new social results. Danny is doing some awesome reporting on this, first in \"<a\nhref=\"http://searchengineland.com/search-engines-should-be-like-santa-107400\">Search Engines Should Be Like Santa From “Miracle On 34th Street”</a>\", later <a\nhref=\"http://marketingland.com/schmidt-google-not-favored-happy-to-talk-twitter-facebook-integration-3151\">in an interview with Schmidt</a>.</p><p><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-40905 alignright\" title=\"wordpress-seo-personalized\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wordpress-seo-personalized.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"272\" height=\"123\" />Google used to have access to the Twitter firehose, all the tweets coming in in realtime, enabling them to index tweets at light speed. Facebook used to show some friends of a person on a profile to visitors to that profile who aren\'t logged in, now look at <a\nhref=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fjdevalk&amp;pws=0\">the cache for my Facebook profile</a>: just other people with the same name.</p><p>As I said in a reaction to a <a\nhref=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/105076678694475690385/posts/6K9j9RHA2tC\">Google+ post by Jeff Jarvis</a>: what both Twitter and Facebook are afraid of is that they\'re \"giving\" \"their\" social graph to Google, thereby allowing Google to easily grow its own social network because it would make it <strong>very</strong> easy for Google to suggest friends to you or say \"these friends of yours already use Google+, shouldn\'t you use it too?\". So by opening up, they\'d open their books to a competitor.</p><p>This, ultimately, should be a users choice, not a platform choice. When it does become a user choice, of course Google should favor the social network the user is the most active on, so if I\'m more active on Facebook than on Twitter or Google+, it should highlight that above the others. Right now, it seems to be mostly highlighting Google+, which will raise some eyebrows here and there and is food for discussion.</p><p>A while back at the first Fusion Marketing Experience in Brussels, <a\nhref=\"http://www.basvandenbeld.com/\">Bas van den Beld</a> of <a\nhref=\"http://www.stateofsearch.com/\">State of Search</a> interviewed <a\nhref=\"http://thebrandbuilder.wordpress.com/\">Olivier Blanchard</a> and myself about search and social. We talked about how the two intertwine and can\'t be unraveled, in fact, as Olivier said during the interview: \"it\'s like coffee and cream, once they mix you can\'t get the cream out of the coffee\". See the interview here (the sound is not the best ever, I know):</p><p><iframe\nwidth=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hm-pzHKOBFU?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>The thing is: this is a done deal. There\'s no way back. Search and social have now officially teamed up, so you might as well live with it. It also means that <em>not</em> using Google+ is... Not really an option if you\'re a marketer, but I guess we had that one coming for a while as well.</p><p>So, what does this mean from a tactics perspective? For now, it means: share every post on Google+ too, make sure you have Google+ buttons on your posts and, most importantly: keep building relations with people! It\'s not like that much changed; social mentions might have become a new and maybe even important ranking factor, but even quality links are usually the result of a relation, of social interaction.</p><p>The formula to success didn\'t change: you have to keep building relations / followers / an audience, create great content and make sure people notice it.</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/search-social-cream-coffee/\">Search &#038; Social &#8211; you can&#8217;t get the cream out of the coffee</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

With the <a\nhref=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/\">theme check</a> plugin you can simply check whether that\'s the case for most of the technical aspects. This makes sure you have all the necessary hooks for plugins to do their work. If any of those fail, fix them before even looking at the stuff below.</p><h2 id=\"head\">Head elements</h2><h3 id=\"titles\">Titles</h3><p>The most common issue with SEO plugins and WordPress themes is with titles: theme authors have a tendency to hardcode (sections of) titles into their themes, which results in hard to fix behavior, which I recently <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-themes-page-title/\">discussed here</a> and hasn\'t been fixed in WordPress core yet. In short, your title should be not even a tiny bit longer than this:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; html-script: true; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php wp_title(\'\'); ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</pre><p>If you decide to embed SEO functionality in your theme, you should then put a filter function on to that <code>wp_title</code> functionality just like a plugin would. This allows you to \"unhook\" that filter when an SEO plugin is active.</p><h3 id=\"meta\">Meta\'s</h3><p>Meta tags come in a vast amount of shapes and sizes, but there are only a few that \"matter\". There are the meta description, the meta keywords (<a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/meta-keywords/\">on which I have a strong opinion too</a>) and the meta robots tag. In my opinion, your theme should <em>never</em> embed any of these meta tags, but, if you decide to embed SEO functionality into your theme, write functions for these things and hook them on to the <code>wp_head</code> action.</p><p>Be very, very sure to allow for site owners to fully disable any meta functionality you write. I regularly, read: daily, advise people to change themes when their theme has a lot of SEO stuff embedded that is just plain wrong or collides with other plugins. Make no mistake: a portion of your users, probably a large portion of your users, cares about their SEO. Getting it <em>wrong</em> is worse then not doing anything, so if I were a theme author I\'d most definitely opt for the latter.</p><h3 id=\"link-items\">Link items</h3><p>There are a lot of &lt;link&gt; items that matter for SEO these days. There are <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">rel=canonical</a>, <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=next and rel=prev</a> and a few more. WordPress does rel=canonical on single posts and pages but nowhere else yet, though a <a\nhref=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18660\">patch for core is ready</a> to make WordPress add rel=canonical in more cases, but your theme should not do any of these. You\'re, to be honest, bound to get them wrong.</p><p>If you do decide to add them, do it in the same fashion as meta elements: hook them on to <code>wp_head</code> and make sure site owners can disable the functionality.</p><h2 id=\"body\">Body elements</h2><h3 id=\"breadcrumbs\">Breadcrumbs</h3><p>While the above points make integration for <em>any</em> SEO plugin easier, this point is more specific for my own WordPress SEO plugin. Integration of my breadcrumbs is quite easy, use something like the following code:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( function_exists(\'yoast_breadcrumb\') ) {\n   yoast_breadcrumb(\'&lt;div id=&quot;breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;\',\'&lt;/div&gt;\');\n}</pre><p>This code will not display anything unless the breadcrumbs feature of my SEO plugin is enabled.</p><h4>Breadcrumbs Variables</h4><p>This breadcrumb path takes the following 3 variables:</p><p><strong><code>$prefix</code></strong><br\n/> The code that your breadcrumb should be prefixed with. Default to an empty string.</p><p><strong><code>$suffix</code></strong><br\n/> The code that should be added on the back of your breadcrumb. Default to an empty string.</p><p><strong><code>$display</code></strong><br\n/> If set to false, will return the breadcrumb path instead of echo-ing it. Defaults to true.</p><h3 id=\"other-body-elements\">Other body elements</h3><p>You should take note of my guides on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/blog-headings-structure/\">HTML heading structure</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/html-sitemap-wordpress/\">HTML Sitemaps</a>. While my SEO plugin doesn\'t \"interfere\" with those, it\'s good practice to make them optimal. You should also read my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-theme/\">WordPress SEO Theme Guidelines</a> to make sure you\'re doing all the other necessary things.</p><h2 id=\"plugincheck\">Is your WordPress SEO plugin active?</h2><p>You should check whether a constant named WPSEO_VERSION is defined, preferably like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( defined(\'WPSEO_VERSION\') ) {\n// Disable your SEO stuff\n}</pre><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-plugin-theme-integration-guide/\">WordPress SEO Plugin Theme Integration Guide</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

At first I suspected they were finally using their very strong domain in a smart way, but then I noticed they ranked for terms I <em>know</em> you can\'t rank for without a <em>lot</em> of external links, no matter how strong your domain. Let me tell you how I figured out that they got those external links <em>by embedding links in their clients websites</em>.</p><p>Today I was sick and tired of getting beaten on some rankings I was working hard for, so I decided to dive a bit deeper and see why GoDaddy was ranking as well as they were. When I looked into the link profile for those high ranking pages, I found a lot of homepages linking to these landing pages with highly optimized anchor text. These were anchor texts like \"ssl\", \"bulk email\", \"web hosting\", \"web hosting companies\" etc. Stuff like that just doesn\'t happen by accident, so there had to be a reason for those. I was baffled when I found what they were doing.</p><h2>Want a Website Tonight, anyone?</h2><p>You see, GoDaddy offers a service called \"Website Tonight\"; this service allows you to quite easily create a website by offering you an editor and all sorts of widgets. Not exactly the power of WordPress, but nothing wrong with it from the users perspective. What <em>is</em> wrong is what I found when I created such a website: when you create such a website it has an image in the footer by default saying \"Powered by Website Tonight\". It\'s possible to turn this image off, but most people don\'t bother as in the editor it looks rather harmless, like this:</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: center;\"><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-32889 aligncenter\" title=\"WebSite Tonight banner\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/WebSite-Tonight-banner.png\" alt=\"WebSite Tonight banner\" width=\"428\" height=\"238\" /></p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">Now, if it were just that, I don\'t think I\'d be all that bothered (not the border is because the image is selected). The issue is, that on the live test site I created, it looks like this:</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\"><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-32890\" title=\"website tonight logo with embedded link beneath it\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/website-tonight-with-link.png\" alt=\"website tonight logo with embedded link beneath it\" width=\"468\" height=\"242\" /></p><p>That link wasn\'t there in the preview... That\'s called deceiving your customer. Note that by default, the image is black, you can switch it to white or you can switch it off, but in the editor <em>it\'ll always show</em>. This is probably the reason why some people choose to use the white version, as they think they can\'t disable it and want a version that\'s less ugly on their design.</p><h2>Example time</h2><p>Ok it\'s time I show you some real live examples of these I guess, these websites all have ugly links like that in their footer:</p><ul><li><a\nhref=\"http://www.motorinsurancee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.motorinsurancee.com/</a></li><li><a\nhref=\"http://www.universalhealthinfo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.universalhealthinfo.com/</a></li><li><a\nhref=\"http://www.autoinsurancecoinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.autoinsurancecoinc.com/</a></li><li><a\nhref=\"http://handson3rd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://handson3rd.com/</a></li><li><a\nhref=\"http://www.onemilerunner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.onemilerunner.com/</a></li><li><a\nhref=\"http://www.trophyshowroom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.trophyshowroom.com/</a></li></ul><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">But those links don\'t work, right? Wrong.</h2><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">Google has been telling us for quite a while now that <a\nhref=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0fgh5RIHdE\">footer links etc. are not that important</a>. Well guess what, that\'s not true if you have enough of them. Using <a\nhref=\"http://www.searchmetrics.com/en/\">SearchMetrics</a> I ran a report for the top keywords they rank in the top 3 for. Each and every keyword in there that is not their brand name, from website hosting to webhosting to website builder, to domain name registration and more: all of those landing pages have exact match anchor text links pointing to them. All coming from these types of domains, thousands if not tens of thousands of clients <em>who are paying for a service</em>, are unknowingly also helping GoDaddy\'s business by helping it rank.</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">These links are on by default. They are <em>not</em> editorial. It\'s not the first time this happened, <a\nhref=\"http://forums.hostgator.com/hostgator-adding-advertisments-my-sites-t74516.html\">Hostgator has been caught</a> adding links to their clients websites in the same way, I mention that in <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-hosting/\">my WordPress hosting article</a>. The issue is that Google rewards these kinds of practices with top rankings, which they shouldn\'t.</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">How well this works, well by my estimate they started doing this more aggressively in September / October of this year, see how their visibility according to SearchMetrics almost doubled:</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\"><a\nclass=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/godaddy-searchmetrics1.png\" rel=\"thickbox\"><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-32892\" title=\"godaddy visibility according to searchmetrics\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/godaddy-searchmetrics1-590x211.png\" alt=\"godaddy visibility according to searchmetrics\" width=\"580\" height=\"207\" /></a></p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">This would correlate well with the <a\nhref=\"https://www.majesticseo.com/\">Majestic SEO</a>\'s historic back link data:</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\"><a\nclass=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/godaddy-majesticseo_backlinks_history_backlinks.png\" rel=\"thickbox\"><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-32899\" title=\"Majestic SEO backlink history for GoDaddy\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/godaddy-majesticseo_backlinks_history_backlinks-590x147.png\" alt=\"Majestic SEO backlink history for GoDaddy\" width=\"580\" height=\"144\" /></a></p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">For hosting related terms like the ones GoDaddy targets, doubling your search engine visibility like that is worth a fortune. To show you even more how blatant these links are, this is a screenshot of the top pages report in Majestic, after doing an advanced historic report, look at the anchor texts and notice that the two with a flag on the right are reported wrongly, the anchor text for the link in fact is email marketing there as well.

What I think happened in September / October that made me catch them was that they started doing this for more keywords.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The long and short of it</h2><p>GoDaddy is playing this game a bit too aggressively in my opinion, and Google should really start discounting those links. The right way would be for GoDaddy to <em>ask</em> their customers whether they\'re allowed to insert a link and make them choose where it points. No single customer would, by own volition, link to an email marketing page...</p><p>I am, though, disappointed in Google\'s filtering of these links; there are far too many spammy links pointing at those pages that:</p><ul><li>have a very unnatural anchor text distribution</li><li>they\'re <em>all</em> in the footer of these sites</li><li>are distributed over only a select number of IP\'s.</li></ul><p>Those 3 things combined, I can\'t believe they didn\'t catch that.</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">Disclaimer: I\'m not saying anything that GoDaddy does here is illegal from a legal point of view. In my opinion it\'s against search engines guidelines <em>and </em>they\'re not transparent towards their customers, so I\'d call it bad karma.</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: left;\">Thanks goes out to Dixon Jones of <a\nhref=\"https://majesticseo.com\">Majestic SEO</a> and Marcus Tober of <a\nhref=\"http://www.searchmetrics.com\">SearchMetrics</a> for helping me figure all this out.</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/godaddy-link-building/\">GoDaddy&#8217;s spammy link building techniques</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

In the process they have also made some changes to how combined author / rich snippets are shown. Let me run you through what I\'ve seen over the last few days.</p><h2>Review snippets for everyone</h2><p>For a while now, I had review snippets showing on my blog posts and pages here on yoast.com that I\'d marked up appropriately. Over the last weeks I started noticing that I was seeing more rich snippets show up in more and more SERPs on sites that had not had them before. Yesterday I did a post on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.nl\">my Dutch blog</a> to test this. I added a plugin called <a\nhref=\"http://www.gdstarrating.com/\">GD Star Rating</a>, which allows people to rate posts.</p><p>This plugin has the ability to add rich snippet markup, but does it in a rather \"hackish\" way by hiding it:</p><p><a\nclass=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GD-Star-Rating.png\"><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-32839\" title=\"GD Star Rating - rich snippets\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GD-Star-Rating-590x203.png\" alt=\"GD Star Rating - rich snippets\" width=\"580\" height=\"199\" /></a></p><p>It was good enough for testing though. I published <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.nl/site-basics-ii-favicon/\">a post about favicons</a>, immediately gave it a 5 star rating myself so when Google spidered it, it had a rating, and low and behold, within the hour, this was showing in the Dutch SERPs:</p><p><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-32840 alignnone\" title=\"yoast favicon result with rich snippets\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/yoast-favicon.png\" alt=\"yoast favicon result with rich snippets\" width=\"489\" height=\"97\" /></p><p>Immediate rich snippets... You used to need to be whitelisted for this, but that doesn\'t seem to be the case anymore. I\'ve tested this with both <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/implement-hreview-wordpress-theme/\">microformat hreview markup</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://schema.org\">schema.org</a> markup and both work 100% fine, <em>even when hidden</em>. That last bit is \"new\" as Google has always stated that you should <em>not</em> hide your code for rich snippets, which is also what I disliked about GD star rating. In most cases though, it\'s absolutely unnecessary to hide the results, you\'ll want to show them with stars and you can still make that machine readable too.</p><p>The conclusion here is simple: if you <em>have</em> reviews and you haven\'t marked them up as a rich snippet yet, go do that <em>immediately</em>. I\'ve written how to\'s on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/implement-hreview-wordpress-theme/\">hreview &amp; rich snippets for WordPress </a>and on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/rich-snippets-magento/\">rich snippets for Magento</a> in the past, use those. For some of my clients I\'ve seen as much as 20 to 30% uplift in the past, on the same rankings, when getting rich snippets, just because more people clicked on those results.</p><h2>Combined rich snippets and author highlights</h2><p>If you do a lot of searching for WordPress related terms in the English Google results you\'ll know that I have a so called \"author highlight\", based on the <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-rel-author-rel-me/\">rel=author markup</a> (for which you <em>do</em> still need to be whitelisted):</p><p><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-32841 alignnone\" title=\"wordpress seo author higlight\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wordpress-seo-author-higlight.png\" alt=\"wordpress seo author higlight\" width=\"523\" height=\"110\" /></p><p>These aren\'t live in any other languages than english yet, so that\'s why you\'re not seeing that for my yoast.nl domain yet. A while ago, the combination of an author highlight with a rich snippet for a review would look like this:</p><p><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-32842 alignnone\" title=\"author review rich snippet\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/author-review-rich-snippet.png\" alt=\"author review rich snippet\" width=\"553\" height=\"92\" /></p><p>Google <a\nhref=\"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/12/google-search-pages-hide-1-buttons.html\">dropped the +1 button recently</a>, as in, it only shows on hover now. But what also changed is how this rich snippet is displayed, the author image is made a bit smaller and now the result looks like this:</p><p><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-32843 alignnone\" title=\"use google libraries rich snippet\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/use-google-libraries-rich-snippet.png\" alt=\"use google libraries rich snippet\" width=\"530\" height=\"125\" /></p><p>While it looks a bit less \"prominent\" it actually takes up a bit <em>more</em> space in the search results and shows the authors name twice, which seems weird to me, so I think they\'ll change at some point too.</p><h2>Other rich snippets</h2><p>It seems as though you still need to be whitelisted for other types of snippets. For instance, I implemented the new <a\nhref=\"http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1645432\">software application snippets</a> for my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics for WordPress plugin</a> pages, which would look something like this according to the <a\nhref=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets?url=http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">rich snippets testing tool</a>:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-32844\" title=\"Rich Snippets Application\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rich-snippet-application.png\" alt=\"Rich Snippets Application\" width=\"528\" height=\"88\" /></p><p>But those aren\'t showing yet, nor are the reviews embedded in it.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There\'s no more reason to wait with adding rich snippet markup to your pages, you really should just do it right now. I very much doubt whether this will continue to be as easy as it seems to be now though. It seems to me as though this is to easy to spam and no doubt affiliates will make a lot of use of this \"feature\". My guess is that soon we\'ll be wishing for Google to go back to actually white listing websites for rich snippets for reviews as well, because are results have become too cluttered.</p><p>Check out this video from when Google introduced Rich Snippets:</p><p><iframe\nwidth=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tXGwVKq-PLE?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/rich-snippets-everywhere/\">Rich Snippets showing up everywhere</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Keep on reading!</p><h2>Why change your WordPress permalink structure?</h2><p>Most of the time I tell people to change their WordPress permalink structure, it\'s to get rid of the dates in their permalink structure. If their content is \"timeless\", it just shouldn\'t be there. In my opinion, the only type of site that should have dates in their permalink structure is a news site. All other sites should strive to write content that is \"timeless\".</p><p>Having a date in your permalink structure has proven to diminish the <abbr\ntitle=\"Click Through Ratio\">CTR</abbr> from the search results for older posts. People are just not likely to click on a result that\'s two years old, even though it might very well be that your post has the answer they seek. With Google seeming to use that CTR more and more as a (very valid) ranking signal, that\'s becoming a more serious factor each day. I did a long post on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-url-permalink/\">WordPress SEO URL / Permalink considerations</a> a while back, you might want to (re-)read that.</p><h2>Performance considerations</h2><p>Up until WordPress 3.3, there was / is indeed a quite serious performance issue when you have a lot of pages when you use just /%postname%/, luckily, that is solved in WordPress 3.3. I have debated people quite a bit saying that it\'s easily solved with some caching but having it fixed in core is a big step ahead, so there are no more excuses to not use /%postname%/.</p><h2>Changing WordPress Permalink Structure</h2><p>There are two steps in changing your WordPress permalink structure. The first is simple, go to Settings -&gt; Permalinks and select Post name:</p><div\nid=\"attachment_31317\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 585px\"><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-31317\" title=\"WordPress Permalink Settings\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/WordPress-Permalink-Settings2.png\" alt=\"WordPress Permalink Settings\" width=\"575\" height=\"299\" /><p\nclass=\"wp-caption-text\">Change your WordPress Permalink Settings</p></div><p>If you don\'t have the post name option yet, you\'re not on WordPress 3.3, the release of which is imminent. You could wait a bit for the update, or you could just add /%postname%/ as a custom permalink structure.</p><p>The second step is to redirect your old permalinks to your new ones. To do that, you have to add redirects to your <em>.htaccess</em> file, I have created a little tool that generates these redirects for you based on your domain and your old permalink structure. To use this tool, click the button:</p><p><a\nclass=\"thickbox-iframe button\" href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-content/permalink-helper.php\">Generate Redirects</a></p><p>There you have it! If you copied the redirect into your <em>.htaccess</em>, you should test whether it\'s working. If it\'s not, chances are you\'re not allowed to use RedirectMatch, which makes changing your WordPress Permalink Structure a bit harder and not something I can easily cover in this post.</p><p>Let me know whether the tool works for you and what you\'ve done to your permalinks!</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/change-wordpress-permalink-structure/\">How to change your WordPress Permalink Structure</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

What most people don\'t realize is that they\'re asking the wrong question. You see, sites don\'t rank: pages rank. If you want to rank for a keyword, you\'ll need to determine which page is going to be the page ranking for that keyword.</p><p>Adding that keyword to the title of <em>every</em> page is not going to help. Nor is writing 200 articles about it without one central article to link all those articles to. You need one single page that is the center of the content about that topic. One \"hub\" page, if you will.</p><p>That page will need to be 100% awesome in all ways. Brian Clark of Copyblogger calls this type of content \"cornerstone content\" and has written <a\nhref=\"http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-create-cornerstone-content-that-google-loves/\" target=\"_blank\">an awesome article about it</a> (a few years ago, already). In fact, go and read Brian\'s article, he explains that way better than I can, I\'ll wait... ... ... You\'re back? Ok, read on:</p><h2>Position that new Cornerstone Content within your site</h2><p>That article said a lot, right? It told you about keyword research, title tags and headlines, content and why your content needs to be awesome and more. Now let\'s talk about where, <em>within your site</em>, that content is going to live. In my opinion, really important content deserves a <em>page</em> within your site\'s structure, not a news item / post. It should be easily navigated to within a few clicks.</p><p>So, you go ahead and create that page within your site. Take some time for it, this is going to be the content that\'s going to make you rank, but not just that, it\'s going to be the content that <em>is ranking</em>. Which means real people will read it too and you need to convert those people. So think about search engines all you want, but think even more about the visitor that will end up on that page and give him / her something worth while.</p><h2>Creating Internal Links</h2><p>Now, once you have that cornerstone page, it\'s time for the next step: creating internal links for your article. You\'re going to do this by figuring out which pages Google already thinks are relevant for your targeted keyword / key phrase. The easiest way to figure out which pages Google thinks are relevant for that keyword is doing a \"site:\" search in Google. So if I were to try and find the most important page for \"website review\" within yoast.com, I\'d search for:</p><pre>site:yoast.com website review</pre><p>You will probably find more than a few pages within your site. Go into each of those pages and add a link to your new cornerstone content. If possible, use the keyword you\'re targeting as the anchor text for that link, but most importantly: link from <em>within the content</em>. Don\'t just add some site wide sidebar / footer links. The reason for this is simple: links from within content are way more valuable than links from sidebars.</p><p>Afterwards, when you\'re writing more content for your site, when you touch on a topic related to your cornerstone content, don\'t forget to link to it! Now, let\'s go on to the last and final step:</p><h2>Promote your Cornerstone Content</h2><p>If you\'ve created it well, your cornerstone content is something to be proud of, something that others will easily share and thus also something that will attract links. Don\'t be afraid to reach out to other people who have written about related topics: show them what you created and that it might be worth while for their visitors to see that. You might even want to offer them to write a guest post about the topic, linking back to your article.</p><p>Stock photo credit: <a\nrel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-17789008/stock-photo-computer-generated-concept-of-cornerstone.html\">Computer Generated Concept Of Cornerstone from Shutterstock</a>.</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/cornerstone-content-rank/\">Using Cornerstone Content to make your Site Rank</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

If those emails do not reliably reach you or your (prospective) customers, you\'re, quite literally, losing business.</p><p>After a couple of years of struggling with email I have finally found the solution to make sure each of my emails reaches the inbox of its recipient and I\'m about to share it with you.</p><p>Note: this is <em>not</em> a paid review. In fact, since <a\nhref=\"http://postmarkapp.com/\">Postmark</a> doesn\'t have an affiliate program, it\'s not even a post with some affiliate links. It\'s just me solving a problem for myself that I hope you will now be able to solve too.</p><h2>The problem: email not reaching its recipient</h2><p>I wrote about <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/email-reliability/\">email reliability</a> before, but let\'s be honest: getting all the web servers we use for sites to send email reliably is a pain. You need to setup SPF records, preferably set up <a\nhref=\"http://www.dkim.org/\">DKIM</a> too <em>and</em> make sure that your web servers <a\nhref=\"http://www.mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx\">do not get blacklisted</a>. One of my servers, for which I had set up SPF, for some stupid reason got blacklisted a couple of weeks ago, resulting in a couple of <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website review</a> emails not reaching my customers. I hated that so much that I started looking for another solution.</p><p>On this site, I had switched from Gravity Forms to <a\nhref=\"http://wufoo.com/\">Wufoo</a> a while back. Wufoo is another awesome web forms service, with the at that time \"added value\" that Wufoo would take care of the email sending for me. My main gripe with using Wufoo was that I really wanted my forms and the entries of my forms in my site\'s install, not somewhere else. On top of that, Gravity Forms gives me a bit more programming flexibility, so I wanted it back. So, I had two email problems and started to look for a solution to both at the same time.</p><h2>Postmark: reliable email</h2><p>I found that solution in <a\nhref=\"http://postmarkapp.com/\">Postmark</a>, which handles transactional email through a set of reasonably simple but <a\nhref=\"http://developer.postmarkapp.com/\">reliable API\'s</a>. Using this <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/Znarkus/postmark-php\">pre-built library</a>, I was able to replace the email sending in my website review application for Postmark within about 10 minutes.</p><p>Yes, Postmark costs a bit of money, but if you consider that at <a\nhref=\"http://postmarkapp.com/pricing\">$1,50 per thousand emails</a>, you run a lot smaller chance of losing customers over email not reaching its destination, it seems to me that that\'s money well-spent.</p><p>It took me a bit longer to code a WordPress plugin that I liked for Postmark. There are a <a\nhref=\"http://developer.postmarkapp.com/developer-libs.html#wordpress\">couple of WordPress plugins</a> listed on the Postmark site, but all of them relied on CURL, which I don\'t have on every server I run WordPress on, and they all ignored some of the headers that plugins like <a\ntitle=\"Gravity Forms\" href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-plugin-review/gravity-forms/\">Gravity Forms</a> passed along. So I used the same pre-built library, but adapted it this time to use the <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wp-best-practice/wordpress-http-api/\">WordPress HTTP libraries</a> and added a wrapper to more reliably pick up all the headers that might get added by plugins.</p><p>The result is a plugin that is pretty easy to use, my own <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/postmark-email-plugin/\">Postmark Email for WordPress Plugin</a>.</p><h2>WordPress email sending tips</h2><p>By default, WordPress sends email from wordpress@example.com, where example.com is your domain. In 99% of cases this is a non-existing email address. More and more people, <a\nhref=\"http://blog.postmarkapp.com/post/3726910416/no-no-reply\">including Postmark</a>, are saying that using a non-existent email to send your email from is not a good idea. I agree. So I created wordpress@yoast.com, which gets filtered into a tag in my email.</p><p>The great thing about actually creating that email address is that you can also assign a <a\nhref=\"http://en.gravatar.com/\">gravatar</a> to it.

Things like <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">rel=canonical</a>, <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/tag/rich-snippets/\">rich snippets</a>, <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-rel-author-rel-me/\">rel=author</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=next &amp; rel=previous</a> might make the \"average\" user think that more and more needs to be done. Some of them help us solve problems that we couldn\'t solve before, others allow for new options that just weren\'t there before. So yes, it\'s becoming a bit more technical, no I don\'t really think that\'s a bad thing. Does it mean more websites need an SEO? I don\'t think so, most of that stuff is covered by plugin authors like myself. My <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> for instance already does 2 out of 4 of the above.</p></li><li><p><em>According to you, what is the optimal way to use pagination in web shop pages (categories, filters) to prevent duplicate content issues and crawling issues?</em></p><p>This is one of the hardest bits of e-Commerce SEO, mostly because it differs for each website. We encounter this regularly when we do <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website reviews</a>for e-commerce sites: 9 out of 10 sites have bad categorization. I don\'t mind whether you use tags or categories or something else; I do mind if whatever you use isn\'t logical and doesn\'t allow me to easily find all the products you offer.</p><p>Faceted search results are by far the most user-friendly in my opinion, but come with a set of SEO issues of their own: do you want all facets indexed? Usually the answer is no. Do you then want to keep them all <em>out</em> of the index? No. I want to hand pick which ones are indexed, yes, that\'s hard if not impossible in most systems. So you can understand that this is the sort of thing I can\'t answer in a couple of paragraphs, or even in a longer article. It requires a per site analysis and testing.</p></li><li><p><em>How do you think G+ will help SEO for your website?</em></p><p>It\'s already helping. Author highlighting through rel=author in combination with Google+ is proving to be a tremendous improver of click through rates from the search results. What would you click on? If you saw 5 results and one of them had an author picture next to it and stated the author was in 10,000+ circles? Right. Awesomeness.</p><p>For the \"average blogger\" though, who\'s not getting highlighted in the search results yet and doesn\'t have a big following on Google+, it might seem less obvious. But trust me: you want to invest the time in it.</p></li><li><p><em>Any WordPress Plugin you recommend to manage Schema microformats?</em></p><p>None really. I think most of that belongs in your theme. The couple of plugins I\'ve seen out there that say they do stuff with microformats do it through filthy hacks, or by hiding data. I would really suggest reading my articles on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/tag/rich-snippets/\">rich snippets</a> and implementing it in your theme.</p></li><li><p><em>Why does adding more content doesn\'t automatically lead to more visitors anymore? Do you really need links to every post to get the traffic?</em></p><p>Yes you need links. Loads of unlinked pages within your site will usually not help you an awful lot anymore, even though it might have in the past. It depends a bit on your domain authority though, any post on this site will rank, regardless of whether that individual post has a lot of links to it or not. What does help is that I have a relatively \"ok\" internal link distribution and I tend to interlink my posts a lot.</p></li><li><p><em>If you were to write the 10 commandments of WordPress &amp; SEO, what would they be?</em></p><p>Well, let\'s see, commandment #1: install &amp; configure my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a>. #2 through to #8: write great content. Commandment #9: properly tag / categorize that content. Commandment #10: talk to your prospective audience about what you\'ve written on every platform that audience uses and engage with them. Bonus commandment #11: forget all other technical tricks.</p></li><li><p><em>What is the best html5 resource you recommend (book or site) so I can point some of our programmers in that direction?</em></p><p>Buy them <a\nhref=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers\">this small book</a> from Jeremy Keith &amp; the great guys at A Book Apart, then send them to <a\nhref=\"http://diveintohtml5.info/\">Dive Into HTML5</a>.</p></li><li><p>Best one for last: <em>From your view, how to Recover from a Google Panda Penalty?</em></p><p>The sites I\'ve seen that really got hit don\'t really stand a chance of coming back, and usually rightfully so. The quick &amp; dirty guide though is: get rid of <em>all</em> your low quality pages and make sure you offer a fantastic user experience and loads of added value. By then you won\'t need the Google traffic anymore of course, but that\'s usually the point when you\'ll get it in droves.</p></li></ul><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/q-a-google-plus/\">Questions and Answers &#8211; Google+ edition</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

In almost all cases I do monitor it, in some cases, we talk about them, in a lot of cases we don\'t, as it\'s just not that reliable of a metric. On the other hand, with <a\nhref=\"http://www.seobook.com/false-privacy-claims\">Google hiding referral data</a> more and more, we\'ll need to track rankings to guesstimate some of our improvements. So let me show you what tools I use and how I use them.</p><p><a\nclass=\"clicky_log_outbound\" href=\"http://yoast.com/out/clicky/\">Clicky</a> (aff) has recently added what I call passive rank tracking to their already awesome analytics package. André wrote about stuff you can do with the <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/track-seo-rankings-and-sitelinks-with-google-analytics-ii/\">rank tracking in the Google referrer data</a> over 2 years ago here on Yoast. About 2 years ago as well, I used this same referrer data to build a passive rank tracker, independent of Google Analytics, because I wanted to do things with that SEO ranking data that I couldn\'t do in Google.</p><p>The one metric I wanted most of all from that big blog of SEO ranking data is the average rank from referrers. You see, because of personalized search results, rankings are never the same and there\'s no \"good\" way of tracking the impact of personalized search. Now you have a semi decent average in Clicky though, so I like that.</p><p>Because Clicky has a pretty <a\nhref=\"https://secure.getclicky.com/helpy?type=api\">decent API</a> too, you could use this to do all sorts of cool stuff. I use this kind of data in combination with <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/sponsored-review-seo-rank-analysis-with-authority-labs/\">Authority Labs</a> and a new toolset in my arsenal, <a\nhref=\"http://sescout.com/\">SEscout</a>. Authority Labs shows me all sorts of info about universal search other tools don\'t give me, SEscout does hourly rankings when you have a paid account, which helps me track fluctuations in \"the force\" more easily.</p><h2>SEO Ranking Data in Aggregate</h2><p>Rankings for specific keywords are very often not that interesting for my clients, as outside of the clients for my <a\ntitle=\"Website Review\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website reviews</a>, most of my SEO clients tend to think in tens or hundreds of thousands, if not millions of keywords, not one, two or ten. So for them I track rankings in aggregate, something you should probably do too if you track more than a couple of keywords. You can then answer questions like \"how did we do on this keyword group\", \"how did we do on that keyword group\". Authority Labs allows you to tag keywords which makes this kind of analysis even easier.</p><p>I then compare that aggregate number to the <a\nhref=\"http://www.searchmetrics.com/en/\">SearchMetrics</a> data for their site and see how good that number is (usually they correlate very highly), after which I can see how well their competitors did using SearchMetrics as well.</p><p>The issue is with both Authority and SEscout: they don\'t give you the complete view <em>because </em>they don\'t do personalized search, which is good, because we want to know our \"real\" ranking, but it\'s also bad, because it might not always correlate well with our traffic. That\'s where the extra layer <a\nclass=\"clicky_log_outbound\" href=\"http://yoast.com/out/clicky/\">Clicky</a> added comes in, which allows us to see just how much personalized search impacts those real rankings. For quite a few of my own keywords I can see that without personalized search, I\'d get a lot less traffic, while for others it\'s completely the other way around.</p><h2>Always correlate SEO ranking data with Analytics!</h2><p>Of course, no ranking is worth anything if you can\'t correlate it to a decent amount of incoming traffic. Luckily, both the Google Analytics and Clicky API allow you to easily correlate the two and see where you have a chance of gaining more traffic.</p><p>One of my favorite ways of looking at sites SEO ranking data is looking at where they rank inbetween #5 and #10 that\'s already sending traffic. If a keyword you rank #8 for consistently sends you traffic, that\'s a keyword with enough traffic to optimize for and see if you can get into the top 5 or even the top 3.</p><p>And now, it\'s your turn!

My SEO plugin force refreshes the cache because otherwise people start emailing me that stuff doesn\'t work when it works perfectly. On sites with more traffic though, you could also just leave the cache as is and wait it out a bit.</li><li><em>How do I move a WordPress site, changing its permalinks but keeping the social numbers counts (post tweets/likes/shares)?</em><p>The answer to this is an unfortunate but resounding: you don\'t. I\'ve written a tutorial on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/move-wordpress-blog-domain-10-steps/\">moving WordPress to a new domain</a> quite a while ago, but you simply can\'t keep those stats. All the more reason to think long and hard about moving domains...</li><li><em>My buddy <a\nhref=\"http://www.merchandise.nl\">Richard</a> thought he was funny, and asked: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a wouldchuck could chuck wood?</em><p>The answer is simple, of course: a woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.</li><li><em>Will you be focusing on wordpress for the rest of your life? If not what do you think will be the reason why you change your focus?</em><p>I might be smart, but I\'m no sightseer. Also, while I work with WordPress a lot, a lot of my time is also spent on <a\ntitle=\"SEO Consulting Services\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/seo-consulting-services/\">consulting</a> and <a\ntitle=\"Website Review\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website reviews</a> (which we do for all sorts of sites).</li><li><em>What is the best practice to SEO a WordPress.com site? Is it even possible?</em><p>Of course there are things you could do on a WordPress.com site, some themes there are better than others and you can do a whole lot content wise. The minute you start asking questions like that though, you should <em>really</em> consider getting a self-hosted WordPress.org install and taking control of your own destiny. You\'ll reach a point where you\'ll want to do more and WordPress.com doesn\'t allow you to do that and the longer you wait, the harder it is to move, so, move now.</li><li><em>When do you think that WordPress is going to completely rewrite their code base so it\'s an actual CMS instead of a hacked together glorified blogging system?</em><p>I find I get that question quite a lot and it annoys me. WordPress is being rewritten all the time. Check out the development that happens on <a\nhref=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">Trac</a>. Most of the people who ask questions like that haven\'t had a decent look at the codebase for ages. WordPress IS way more than a glorified blogging system already and if there are specific issues you have with the way it\'s coded, <a\nhref=\"http://westi.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/patches-welcome/\">patches are welcome</a>!</li><li><em>If you start working on a WordPress blog for a client and there are no plugins installed, which ones do you always install?</em><p>A couple: my own <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO</a> &amp; <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics</a> plugins, <a\ntitle=\"W3 Total Cache and why you should be using it\" href=\"http://yoast.com/w3-total-cache/\">W3 Total Cache</a> and usually <a\ntitle=\"Gravity Forms\" href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-plugin-review/gravity-forms/\">Gravity Forms</a>. Of course each site is different so there\'ll be more plugins after that depending on that site\'s and site owners needs and wants.</li><li><em>What do you think has more value? A good domain name or good link building?</em><p>Good link building, any day, every day. You see, domain names, especially so called \"exact match domain names\" are bound to be devalued at some point. Good link building will always create traffic to your site, just from those links alone, so that\'s always worth while. Those links also bring in rankings but in really good link building, that\'s often just a side effect. I recently talked about Eric Ward\'s mailing list, you should <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/link-building-tips/\">check out that post</a>.</li><li><em>Your SEO plugin places a canonical tag on every generated page and I have an ongoing argument with a co-worker about that. He says that this tag should only be on pages that contain duplicate content and that it is intended to \'tell\' the searchbot where to look for the original content. Googling around doesn\'t clarify a lot. Could you please tell your reasons behind placing it on every page?</em><p>I get this discussion a lot. The thing is, if I was 100% sure that a URL could only be accessed through that specific URL with no query parameters added, I might not add a canonical. There\'s nothing <em>against</em> it, but it\'d just be a bit cleaner. However, these URLs:</p><p>http://www.example.com/</p><p>http://www.example.com/?campaign=email</p><p>Are essentially the same for a WordPress install in 99% of the cases. However, they\'re not the same for Google and other search engines. So, if I wouldn\'t add canonical, the link value of the second URL would be waisted and, in fact, you\'d have a competing duplicate content URL in the search results. That\'s why I add it to all pages.</li><li><em>I noticed you don\'t use a comment system like disqus or intense debate. Would be nice to hear your thoughts about whether we should or should not use a comment system in WordPress.</em><p>If I were to use a comment system, I\'d use Facebook comments. The benefits of that and the fact that it gets way less spam are quite high. So far I\'ve decided not to do that yet because a couple of my regular visitors and active commenters actually don\'t have Facebook accounts. Also, my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/comment-redirect/\">comment redirect</a> plugin doesn\'t work with those systems, which I think is a pity.</p><p>I\'ll say one thing: the amount of work I have to do to keep this blog spam free is nothing short of ridiculous. Read <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/prevent-anonymous-comments-wordpress/\">this post</a> to see what I mean.</li></ul><p>That\'s it, what do you think, should I do this more often?</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/questions-and-answers/\">Questions and Answers</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Simple: I wanted the site analysis, which is a report on how to improve your site in key areas such as SEO to Usability to Site Speed &amp; more, to be more easily accessible to more people.

This service is aimed at exactly that and with this new price point I think it\'s something that most SMBs should be able to afford.</p><p>To be able to get to that lower price, I\'ve been working on the system by which I create site analyses over the past weeks. I used to do them all by myself, but since I sell several of these a week now, sometimes even several a day, I can\'t keep doing that. I also noticed that I was telling the same things an awful lot, people tend to make the same \"mistakes\" all the time.</p><h2>Getting some help</h2><p><img\nclass=\"alignright  wp-image-15131\" title=\"michiel-heijmans\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/michiel-heijmans.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" />The conclusion was simple, I needed to outsource the \"simpler bits\" to someone who has a bit more time on his hands and only do the hard bits myself. Now, the simpler bits aren\'t all that simple, to be honest, which is why it took me a while to find someone who wanted to do those <em>and</em> had the capabilities needed to do it.

He co-founded <a\nhref=\"http://aboutblank.nl/\">about:blank</a>, a famous Dutch e-zine about blogs &amp; social media. Michiel knows an awful lot about <em>all</em> aspects of websites, from conversion to usability and more. On the last few reviews we\'ve been working together and I noticed that because the two of us look at each site now, we actually give <em>more</em> feedback instead of less. And now we do that for a lower price.</p><h2>Actionable Results</h2><p>While the feedback I got for my site analyses has always been good, one of the remarks I got from people is \"you\'ve suggested so much, where do I start?\". I fully understand that, the report needed to be more actionable, this is why all site analyses from now on will contain a to do list, ordered by a priority from 1 (high) to low (5).</p><p>At €495, which is currently less than $680, the cost of the analysis is far far lower than the value it represents in turn-over and profit. If you want my feedback on your site, because you\'re stuck in improving it, or haven\'t even started yet and want to know where to begin, you should <strong><a\ntitle=\"Website Review\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">order a website review right now</a></strong>!</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/site-analyses-now-495/\">Lowering the Price for Site Analyses</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

This is now changing, rapidly, though!</p><p>Last friday I was telling my buddy Remkus de Vries, known as <a\nhref=\"http://twitter.com/defries\" target=\"_blank\">@DeFries</a> on Twitter, that I was almost done with the internationalization support for my <a\ntitle=\"WordPress SEO Plugin\" href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress SEO plugin</a>. He told me that I should be using <a\nhref=\"http://blog.glotpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GlotPress</a>, which is a collaborative, web-based software translation tool maintained by some of the people behind WordPress. I concurred and asked him to set it up for me.</p><p>He did and he wrote a post about it: <a\nhref=\"http://remkusdevries.com/how-to-use-glotpress-for-your-translations/\" target=\"_blank\">How to use GlotPress for your translations</a>. After a bit of work on my side on getting a registration form going, I tweeted about my GlotPress being there on <a\nhref=\"http://translate.yoast.com\" target=\"_blank\">translate.yoast.com</a>. Within 20 minutes about 10 people had registered and started translating. I was very excited about that and decided to look into it a bit better by the following morning, when 14 people in total had signed up already.</p><p>Because I could see this becoming unmanageable quite soon, I decided to create a mailing list for the contributors. As you\'ll see when you\'ve read Remkus\' post I listed above, we use a WordPress install on <a\nhref=\"http://translate.yoast.com/register/\" target=\"_blank\">/register/</a> to manager the users. This allows me to use <a\ntitle=\"Gravity Forms\" href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-plugin-review/gravity-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravity Forms</a>, along with its User Registration add-on, to allow people to register. Because I built it that way, it was a piece of cake to add the Mailchimp add-on and make sure all new translator were connected to the mailing list as well.</p><p>Be sure that when you set it up like this too, you make the language people want to translate into a variable in MailChimp too, so later on you can easily segment on that, by emailing just the people who are translating your plugin(s) into Polish, for instance.</p><p>The amount of people working on this has surprised me. I\'ve tweeted about it twice and so far, 31 people have signed up and are actively translating into 12 different languages, so far translating 2568 sentences!</p><h2>Your turn?</h2><p>Are you using WordPress in your native language?

In Genesis there is the option to canonicalize the subpages back to the first page of an archive. I have said, and will keep saying that I think that that\'s the sole big SEO mistake in that theme.</p><h2>Enter rel=\"next\" and rel=\"prev\"</h2><p>Now, as it goes with these things, <a\nhref=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/09/pagination-with-relnext-and-relprev.html\">Google has just posted the solution</a>. They\'ve asked to add <code>rel=\"next\"</code> and <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> to paginated archives, so that they can distinguish them as a series and, quote:</p><blockquote><p>Send users to the most relevant page/URL—typically the first page of the series.</p></blockquote><p>Bingo! That\'s what we want. The syntax is very simple. On <code>http://yoast.com/cat/seo/page/2/</code> we should have a prev link pointing to the first page in the series and a next link pointing to the <em>next</em> page in the series, like so:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;link rel=\'prev\' href=\'http://yoast.com/cat/seo/\' /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\'next\' href=\'http://yoast.com/cat/seo/page/3/\' /&gt;</pre><p>Now I think this should be added in WordPress core, but of course it currently isn\'t. We have some other relation links in core right now, most of which are useless. In fact – with the exception of <code>rel=\"prev\"</code> and <code>rel=\"next\"</code> – <a\nhref=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18128\">they\'ll be removed from core anyway</a>. I\'m working on a patch for that combined with the <a\nhref=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18672\">ticket to add this to core</a>. I\'ll probably need to combine that with the work Nathan and I were doing on canonical on <a\nhref=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18660\">another ticket</a>.</p><h2>Already in WordPress SEO by Yoast</h2><p>For now though, I\'ve added this functionality to my WordPress SEO plugin, so all you have to do is update to version 1.0.2 and you\'ll be taken care of!</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=&#8221;next&#8221; &#038; rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; for paginated archives</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Quite a few people responded and a lot of them weren\'t too happy. On top of that, there were several instances of downtime in both the AMS and several US clouds over the last week. As you might know, I\'m an affiliate for VPS.net, so I get a bit better every time they get a new client through me, but I was seriously debating whether that was still a wise choice. In fact, some people were telling me that I should stop recommending them altogether.</p><p>Now, I\'ve been with VPS.net for quite some time, from their very beginning in fact, and I\'ve always liked the service and the people working there. I\'m not one to easily leave and on top of that, having had issues at other hosting companies before, I know that things are bound to go wrong at some point. So, I decided to confront my contacts at VPS.net and \"talk to the boss\". That boss is someone I hadn\'t spoken to before, Rus Foster. Rus has recently (7 weeks ago) joined VPS.net as their new Managing Director, although he\'s been in the VPS business for years, replacing Nick Nelson, who\'s gone higher up in the UK2 Group.</p><p>As you can see, I asked him some, I think, rather tough questions. I was happy with the answers I got, and must say that the changes he\'s talking about below on the AMS cloud have indeed had a very positive effect on my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.nl\">yoast.nl</a> server.</p><h2>Interview with Rus Foster, MD of VPS.net</h2><p><strong>Hi Rus, thanks for agreeing to this interview. My goal is to shed some light on what is currently causing all the issues around VPS.net. First of all, it seems as though every day, somewhere in the world, a VPS.net SAN dies. Some locations have more issues than others, but in general, it\'s been quite bad lately. What\'s causing that? And, more importantly, what will you do about it?</strong></p><p>Start with the easy questions eh? Nothing like whats your favourite colour? :)</p><p>Seriously though yes there have been SAN issues on some of our newer clouds.</p><p>Some of the SANS in multiple locations have been showing instability issues caused by the software running on them. As such we are starting to undertake a very aggressive upgrade schedule to move the SAN software to the latest version. Coupled with this we are also upgrading the storage network within each cloud to increase I/O speeds.</p><p>We are however also looking to start using the enterprise class Nexenta storage solution on our new clouds which is engineered fundamentally different to our current SAN solutions. The upshot of this is that the system is much more resilient to failure meaning in the event of a failure there will be no noticeable effect on customers.</p><p>This will be going live on our next cloud but more about that later .....</p><p><strong>When you say \"very aggressive upgrade schedule\", what do you mean, exactly?</strong></p><p>We have identified 6 clouds where we feel significant upgrades, or full migrations to new facilities are required. We are doing 1-2 clouds a week and aim to have everything completed within the next 6 weeks, if not sooner. This is a significant investment in our infrastructure to increase resiliency and performance.</p><p><strong>To be fair, some people would say that it\'s a significant investment to make it work the way it should... Which clouds are we talking about?</strong></p><p>There were decisions made in the past that were right at the time. Those choices however no longer reflect customers expectations as cloud hosting is becoming more mainstream. We are making decisions now that prepare us for the future allowing easier service enhancements to be rolled out to all our customers new and old. We are targeting clouds in both the US and Europe. Some of the work, for example on our Amsterdam cloud, has been completed.</p><p><strong>Could you say that maybe you\'ve grown a bit too fast? (Which would be partly my fault, perhaps, sorry about that)</strong></p><p>We learn from mistakes. There is nothing wrong with growing fast. There is something wrong with not managing that growth. I would say that is where as a company we found ourselves tripping over our own feet. My personal focus is split into both pushing the growth of the company, looking at exciting new markets and technologies but also its vitally important that we look after our current customers. This is reflected in us bringing back such old favourites as sales live chat but also focussing on how we can help existing customers. This include things such as the cloud upgrades as well as some exciting upgrades we have coming for all customers.</p><p><strong>Apart from the SANs, another issue seems to have been the fact that you weren\'t responding during those outages, either on tickets, or on Twitter, with the status blog being deafeningly silent too. What are you going to do about that?</strong></p><p>Communications. Communications. Communications. Nothing travels as fast as bad news. We need to be quicker. We need to be more open. We are taking steps to do that. We are now proactively emailing customers in the event of an outage. We are making it the sole responsibility for the manager on duty to communicate with customers. The status blog and twitter are important fields of communication but they can\'t give customised responses to each customers. Our support ticket system is in place for that.</p><p><strong>I\'ve seen you jump in on more and more tickets yourself, are you one of those managers on duty?</strong></p><p>Its best to lead by example. I never ask anyone to do something that I wouldn\'t be willing to do myself. When things get busy in an outage its really a matter of needing all hands to the pumps. Thats why you will see me replying to all sorts of support tickets from simple reboots to full implementations of load balancing.</p><p><strong>I get the feeling, talking to some of the people who bought a VPS, that they actually shouldn\'t have a VPS. They have two types of downtime, the one caused by themselves as they don\'t really know their way around a web server, and the ones caused by SANs or other hardware failures at VPS.net. I think that for people who have a lot of those first issues, the new Cloud Hosting, or a somewhat faster WestHost package, both a bit more managed, would be better for them.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you agree? If people think that\'s true for them, is there any way for you to help in that?</strong></p><p>We all love power. As a petrol head I dream of having a TVR Sagaris on the drive but do I need the power? Of course not. Some people do however need that power. It\'s all about what matches your individual needs. If people just have a few websites that need to \"just work\" then a VPS isn\'t always the best choice and there are other things in our current, and upcoming, product range that could suit them better. If however people do require large amounts of customisation VPS are still a good way to go. If they do require that little bit of hand holding they can always get an On-Demand ticket for a one time issue or pop management on top for unlimited help.</p><p>If a customer wants to move to another product we can move a reasonable number of sites free of charge.</p><p><strong>Cool.</strong></p><p><strong>So you mentioned a new cloud...

It allows the user to create and edit types of content, be them post, pages or custom post types and classify them with taxonomies, categories, tags or custom taxonomies. Almost every bit of content a WordPress site outputs is easy to control by the maintainer of that WordPress site. Almost, because there\'s one piece of content that\'s notoriously hard to fully control. That bit is the title, often also called \"meta title\". The way that title is displayed is determined, in large part, by your theme.</p><p>Now I bring this up for a single reason: the title is <em>the</em> single most important piece of content on a page relating to SEO. In the most recent update of <a\nhref=\"http://www.seomoz.org/article/search-ranking-factors#metrics-6\">SEOmoz\'s ranking factors</a>, the presence of a keyword in the title was agreed by SEO\'s to have an \"influence value\" of 94.4 out of 100. That\'s huge.</p><p>In WordPress\' most recent default theme, dubbed Twenty Eleven, the content of that title tag is determined by the following code:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php\n/*\n * Print the &lt;title&gt; tag based on what is being viewed.\n */\nglobal $page, $paged;\n\nwp_title( \'|\', true, \'right\' );\n\n// Add the blog name.\nbloginfo( \'name\' );\n\n// Add the blog description for the home/front page.\n$site_description = get_bloginfo( \'description\', \'display\' );\nif ( $site_description &amp;&amp; ( is_home() || is_front_page() ) )\n	echo &quot; | $site_description&quot;;\n\n// Add a page number if necessary:\nif ( $paged &gt;= 2 || $page &gt;= 2 )\n	echo \' | \' . sprintf( __( \'Page %s\', \'twentyeleven\' ), max( $paged, $page ) );\n\n?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</pre><p>With all due respect, I hate that. The reason I hate that is that it means that on the front page of your site, no matter what you do, your title will always be of this format:</p><p>NAME OF SITE | DESCRIPTION OF SITE</p><p>On other pages, it will be:</p><p>NAME OF ARTICLE | NAME OF SITE</p><p>So we effectively hardcode in our design templates the way we output one of our most important bits of content on a page. That\'s very far from the separation of design &amp; content that the web community at large has been striving for over the last few decades.</p><p>If you\'re now thinking, \"hey, I\'m using that theme and I have another page title for my homepage\", you might be right, I\'ll get to that. The reason you\'re able to do that is also the reason why I regularly get questions about my WordPress SEO plugin and theme X, Y or Z having issues with the title.</p><h2>The bad solution: Output Buffering the page title</h2><p>I don\'t want to spend this entire article explaining what output buffering is, so if you don\'t know, <a\nhref=\"http://www.phpcodebase.com/php-output-buffering-explained/\">this is a rather simple explanation</a>. This process is used by most big SEO plugins. What they do is: catch the output of a page, look for the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, fix the contents of that title, return the output. For the record: if you check the \"Force rewrite titles\" box on the Titles page of my SEO plugin, it does just that. The reason my plugin has had issues with titles is exactly that: I don\'t have that box checked by default.</p><p>Now one can argue over whether output buffering in general is a bad idea or not, the way it\'s done here is arguably bad, although the only current working solution. It uses way more resources than should be needed to change the title <em>and</em>, possibly worse, it effectively disallows other plugins that don\'t do the buffering to have an influence on the title. On top of that, in my testing, on most servers it adds about 0.5 seconds to the page load time.</p><h2>The good solution: something new in core</h2><p>For quite a while, I thought that changing the way we, as a community, use <code>wp_title</code> would be a fix to this. I no longer think that it is. The reason for that is that it would create all sorts of other issues, with themes and plugins alike. In fact, Andrew Nacin already tried to do that a while back, see <a\nhref=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/15195\">this changeset</a>, and reverted the changeset because the output buffering plugins broke because of it. I think we need a new function, specifically aimed at displaying the page title. Ideally this function would hook into wp_head and would be using the theme_supports functionality.</p><p>I\'ve been working with Andrew on a patch, which has been heavily discussed on <a\nhref=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18548\">this Trac ticket</a>. I have good hopes that something along these lines will go into core, but would love to know your opinion.</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-themes-page-title/\">Discuss: The Page Title in WordPress Themes</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/admin/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

From a discussion between myself and <a href=\"http://mikelittle.org/\">Mike Little</a> about <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href=\"http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/\">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href=\"http://cafelog.com\">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445\">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href=\"http://ryan.boren.me/\">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href=\"http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/\">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation\">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href=\"http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/\">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/\">we got excited</a> by <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/\">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/\">Om Malik</a>, <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/\">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/\">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href=\"http://justintimberlake.com/main/\">musicians</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/\">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href=\"http://life.time.com/\">Life</a>, <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/\">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href=\"http://observer.com/\">New York Observer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.compliance.gov/\">government websites</a>, a <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/\">filesystem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp\"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/\">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/history/\">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/\">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href=\"http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/\">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href=\"http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/\">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href=\"http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/\">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/\">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href=\"http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/\">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href=\"http://wp10.wordpress.net/\">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future. Thanks to WordPress and its community that I&#8217;m proud to be part of.</p>\n<p>Thank you.

We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\' alt=\';)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' /> </p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:374:\"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\" href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general.

Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance.

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking: </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus: </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes. But we need your help. <strong>Please test your plugins and themes against 3.6.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) If you&#8217;re a forward-thinking theme developer, you should be looking at implementing the new Post Format support in some of your themes (look to Twenty Thirteen for inspiration).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback. If you break it (i.e. find a bug), please report it, and if you’re a developer, try to help us fix it. We&#8217;ve already had more than 150 contributors to version 3.6 — it&#8217;s not too late to join the party!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-3-6-beta-1/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 3.5.1 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 22:23:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:363:\"WordPress 3.5.1 is now available.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/\">3.4</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href=\"http://ios.wordpress.org/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"http://android.wordpress.org/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/\">Blackberry</a>, <a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/\">Windows Phone</a>, <a href=\"http://nokia.wordpress.org/\">Nokia</a>, and <a href=\"http://webos.wordpress.org/\">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/\">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/support/\">forum support</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/\">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit\">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href=\"http://sopastrike.com/numbers/\">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn&#8217;t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:31:\"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"hourly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 09:12:05 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:23:\"text/xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:10:\"x-pingback\";s:36:\"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sun, 02 Jun 2013 02:32:53 GMT\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 249\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20121211193446\";}', 'no');

src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPUAlogo.jpg?resize=215%2C67\" /></a>The <a title=\"http://wpua.org\" href=\"http://wpua.org\">WordPress Users Association</a> was launched in December of 2010 with the goal of providing a central place for WordPress users to swap war stories, learn how to get the most out of WordPress, and take part in getting special discounts on themes and plugins. Fast forward three years later and the idea appears to have been a bust, despite the look and feel of their website. <em>*Note: This organization has no association to WordPress.org, the WordPress Foundation, or any official aspect of the WordPress project.</em></p>\n<p>Curious about what happened as well as whether they were still accepting payments or not, I reached out to a couple of their corporate sponsors as well as a few of their earlier members to get their accounts of what it was like to be a part of the WPUA. I also signed up for a monthly membership to see if the website was still processing payments and indeed they are. Thankfully Clickbank, their payment processor has a 60 day money back guarantee which I&#8217;ll be utilizing very soon.</p>\n<p>Two of the four platinum level sponsors I contacted, responded. I wanted to know what their experience was like and if they were still currently sponsoring the website. I did reach out to founder John Pozadzides through his personal site OneMansBlog and Twitter a few days ago but at the time of being published, have yet to receive a response. </p>\n<p><strong>Vsellis:</strong> <em>I don&#8217;t think the site has been active for quite a while. I ended my sponsorship a long time ago and see my logo is still up there but I don&#8217;t think there is any activity.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Synthesis Managed WordPress Hosting By Copyblogger Media:</strong> <em>JohnP gave me an account and we simply participated in the forums. We are no longer active though will support anything John is doing.</em></p>\n<p>Then I got in touch with Matthew McGarity, one of the first members to join the WPUA where he shared his experience with the site:</p>\n<p><em>Even after launching, the site wasn&#8217;t terribly active. I suspect that it&#8217;s dead now, considering the front page has remained virtually unchanged since I first registered in September 2010. Also, its Twitter feed appears to be on auto-pilot like the French radio station on &#8220;Lost.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>The site forum&#8217;s design made it difficult to participate in conversations, and it ended up being more work than I cared for. The forums had no RSS feeds, and their email digests were limited to the day&#8217;s top-10 conversations. Something that notified me of new subjects and/or replies to conversations I was a part of would have helped me participate. But remembering to log into the site on a regular basis wasn&#8217;t worth it. I made suggestions on improving this experience; the site owner Wesley Williams took them under serious consideration, but I don&#8217;t think they were ever enabled.</em></p>\n<p><em>John P. and Cali promoted the site at its launch, and friends of mine advertised there. But I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re involved now.</em></p>\n<p><em>At one time, I think they were considering the design of some WordPress certifications (developer, etc.) and the related curriculum/criteria for each, but that didn&#8217;t go anywhere, probably due to lack of value and potential acceptance (e.g. anyone can get certified for anything by anyone).</em></p>\n<p><em>I had a free membership, which limited my access on the site to value propositions that might change my desire to use the site. I&#8217;m savvy and keyed into the open source community enough that I am able to extract the benefits/help I need without having to pay for membership on a site like this. But that is just me.</em></p>\n<h2>Free Themes:</h2>\n<p>While browsing through the four pages of themes offered to paying members only, I noticed most of them didn&#8217;t impress me very much. But more importantly, they are all 2-3 years out of date. Instead of linking themes directly to a repository, the themes were manually uploaded to WPUA. Using outdated themes is a big no no as some of the ones on this site could still contain the <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/the-aftermath-of-the-timthumb-vulnerability\" title=\"http://www.wptavern.com/the-aftermath-of-the-timthumb-vulnerability\">TimThumb vulnerability</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPUAthemes.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPUAthemes.jpg?resize=500%2C211\" alt=\"Outdated Themes\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7184\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Plugins:</h2>\n<p>Their plugins leave a lot to be desired. The plugins that are offered are tailored for internet marketers and are certainly not worth the price of admission. Just seeing one named PopupDomination gives me a bad feeling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPUAPlugins.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPUAPlugins.jpg?resize=182%2C167\" alt=\"WPUA Plugins\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7189\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Video Training:</h2>\n<p>Although there are a bunch of training videos on WPUA.org, none of them work. Instead, when you try to view them, the following error message pops up.

From a discussion between myself and <a href=\"http://mikelittle.org/\">Mike Little</a> about <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href=\"http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/\">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href=\"http://cafelog.com\">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445\">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href=\"http://ryan.boren.me/\">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href=\"http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/\">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation\">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href=\"http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/\">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/\">we got excited</a> by <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/\">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/\">Om Malik</a>, <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/\">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/\">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href=\"http://justintimberlake.com/main/\">musicians</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/\">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href=\"http://life.time.com/\">Life</a>, <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/\">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href=\"http://observer.com/\">New York Observer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.compliance.gov/\">government websites</a>, a <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/\">filesystem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp\"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/\">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/history/\">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/\">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href=\"http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/\">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href=\"http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/\">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href=\"http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/\">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/\">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href=\"http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/\">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href=\"http://wp10.wordpress.net/\">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future.

One of his keys is Blogging. He&#8217;s right in that blogging is the history and heritage of the WordPress software but over the past few years, so much has been done to try to rid the stigma of WordPress being just for blogging. That seems like a trend that will continue so the challenge is, how do we maintain that heritage without it dissolving?</p>\n<p>The first key correlates with another in Identity. To this day, if you ask 10 people what is WordPress, you&#8217;re likely to get at least 7 different answers ranging anywhere from blogging system, publishing platform, to content management system and to top it off, all the answers are correct. The questions Cory asks are very important: <strong>What is WordPress? What is it supposed to do for people? And how do we preserve and protect that while innovating and adapting?</strong> Each feature, each enhancement, everything that goes into WordPress should be focused around the answers to those questions.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think Cory nailed it.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-and-its-cloudy-future\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress And Its Cloudy Future\">WordPress And Its Cloudy Future</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/ithemes-responds-to-speculation-all-is-well\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"iThemes Responds To Speculation &#8211; All Is Well\">iThemes Responds To Speculation &#8211; All Is Well</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/the-future-of-bbpress-lies-within-wordpress\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The Future Of bbPress Lies Within WordPress\">The Future Of bbPress Lies Within WordPress</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/YFjljnCJuSU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 May 2013 17:39:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: 10th Anniversary Interview With WordPress Co-Founder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7169\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/A_0z7n20F44/10th-anniversary-interview-with-wordpress-co-founder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3399:\"<p>WordPress developer Simon Dickson had the chance to sit down with WordPress co-founder Mike Little for about a half hour during their WordPress 10th anniversary party. This is one of the longest interviews with Mike that I&#8217;ve seen and it covers his history of using computers, programming, the beginnings of WordPress and several other topics. One of the biggest takeaways I&#8217;ve had from watching all the interviews with Mike Little is that he is just as humble if not more so than Matt Mullenweg. </p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\"></div>\n<p>When you listen to the story of how WordPress began from Mike&#8217;s perspective, you begin to realize how the planets must have been aligned in order for those two to meet. There are a couple of different time points in the early days of WordPress that could have changed everything. For example, the lead developer for b2 disappeared without a trace for several months. Because of the disappearance and the presence of major bugs as well as the domain coming up for renewal, Matt published his <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">Software Dilemma post</a> where Mike Little volunteered to help out with the forking of b2. If the lead developer didn&#8217;t disappear, would we be using WordPress today? Then there&#8217;s the mass exodus from MoveableType in 2004 after they announced MT3 would have a $70.00 fee attached to it. Considering MT was one of the leading platforms at the time, had MT continued to be free, how would that have affected WordPress as we know it? Last but not least, TextPattern appeared to be everything Matt wanted in a publishing platform but because of its license, decided not to work with it. If TextPattern would have been licensed under the GPL at the time, would WordPress have been created? Ironically, TextPattern is now licensed under the GPL version 2, the same license as WordPress. </p>\n<p>A couple of other tidbits to take away from this interview:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mike Little was responsible for the Links Manager in b2 which ended up as a part of WordPress.</li>\n<li>All of the settings pages, Mike wrote the original options code for those</li>\n<li>He is also responsible for the WP-Configsample.php file to prevent people from overwriting settings</li>\n<li>WordCamp UK Birmingham changed Mikes life because of the amount of people he saw raise their hand when asked how many people make most or all of their living from WordPress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mike was around during the mass exodus from MoveableType in 2004. I&#8217;d like to know if he noticed it, or had any thoughts on that part of WordPress history.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a

wp-image-7164\" /></a>Always on the lookout for new resources to share with others to help learn WordPress related topics, I came across an <a href=\"http://wpthemetutorial.com/downloads/wordpress-development-professional/\" title=\"http://wpthemetutorial.com/downloads/wordpress-development-professional/\">eBook published</a> ($29.99-$39.99) by long time WordPress developer <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/curtismchale\" title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/curtismchale\">Curtis McHale</a>. I got in touch with Curtis to ask him a few questions concerning his book, including whether or not he plans on contributing to the WordPress handbook project.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the inspiration for writing the book?</strong></p>\n<p>I wanted to write the book after dealing with so much code from beginning developers. Yes it was bad, but they just didn&#8217;t know any better so what else could you expect? My hope was that by reading the book a beginning developer, or developer not familiar with WordPress, would have a great set of road signs as they built stuff.</p>\n<p>No it doesn&#8217;t cover every part of WordPress, but it&#8217;s a great overview so that the reader is left with a way to evaluate all the random tutorials you come across online. There are a lot of bad ones, and when you don&#8217;t have any framework to judge them you just use the bad ones with the good..</p>\n<p><strong>Have you seen a good response to the book since its release?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;d say it depends on how you want to measure it. Am I sitting back in a pool of money not doing client work? Nope. Book sales were pretty good at the beginning but they have tapered off quite a bit.</p>\n<p>Out of the few review copies I sent out anyone that has provided any feedback has said that the content is good and does hit it&#8217;s goal.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it&#8217;s still super awesome to wake up and see a book sale, or make a sale on the weekend. I&#8217;m pretty happy with getting it out there and I&#8217;d do another one. So yes I am happy with the response.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you hope readers will gain after reading your book?</strong></p>\n<p>As I said above, a way to judge all the information on WordPress out there. The problem is not finding what you want, it&#8217;s finding something <strong>good</strong>.</p>\n<p>This book is not for experienced developers. You may pick up a few tips/hints but it won&#8217;t be revolutionary at all.</p>\n<p><strong>What will readers find in WordPress Development Professional that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to find in the Codex?</strong></p>\n<p>First, it&#8217;s all in one spot. You don&#8217;t have to dive between 50 different pages to find best practices on Themes, plugins…</p>\n<p>Outside of that, you get a good insight in to how I develop projects. It&#8217;s always interesting to see what someone else does different from you. It at least can make you evaluate the way you do things to see if you&#8217;re right and I&#8217;m wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you thought about contributing to any of the Handbook projects such as Developing WordPress Themes (in adherence to the theme review guidelines) or Developing Plugins for the repository?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes and I was in on a few meetings for the handbooks at the beginning, but I&#8217;m terrible at keeping up with all the IRC meetings. Technically I&#8217;m a Theme Reviewer (haven&#8217;t done much in a while) and I&#8217;ve done a bunch of documentation for 3.5 on specific functions.</p>\n<p>If you really tracked my contributions you&#8217;d find a flurry of activity in one spot (like documentation) then I go dark for a while. With the 3.5 documentation I just got on the blog post about things that were needed and knocked off 10 functions in an afternoon. Did a bit of clean up and then I haven&#8217;t done much with docs since. I had about the same thing going with Theme Review, did a bunch then a few here and there, then I haven&#8217;t done much.</p>\n<p>I always think that I should be doing more to assist, but then it&#8217;s a matter of finding time.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any plans for a second edition?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes there are plans for a second Edition. I&#8217;ve got a bunch of notes going on things I should check up on, some spelling mistakes have been submitted. I&#8217;d like to add screencasts for some portions as well.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s more likely that I&#8217;ll release a few other &#8216;micro courses&#8217;. I&#8217;ve got outlines for Transients, Roles and Caps, and post meta. They&#8217;d have a book, screencasts blog content and access to a general help/discussion forum. Costs will probably be between $10 &#8211; $20 and to keep access to the support forum after a year there will be some fee. At least that&#8217;s my pricing thoughts today. Once I get the outlines done I&#8217;ll put them out to my email list (you know the proven customers) for some voting to see which one goes first.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/new-wordpress-book-for-plugin-development\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"New WordPress Book For Plugin Development\">New WordPress Book For Plugin Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/cashing-in-on-wordpress-plugin-development\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Cashing In On WordPress Plugin Development\">Cashing In On WordPress Plugin Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/idiots-guide-to-wordpress\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Idiot&#8217;s Guide To WordPress\">Idiot&#8217;s Guide To WordPress</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/7IMi52ow5Yc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2013 20:56:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WordPress.tv: Michael Earley: Using Woo Commerce for Online Stores\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19514\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/30/michael-earley-using-woo-commerce-for-online-stores/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:688:\"<div id=\"v-Lbvpb3IC-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19514/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19514/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19514&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/30/michael-earley-using-woo-commerce-for-online-stores/\"><img alt=\"Michael Earley: Using Woo Commerce for Online Stores\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/Lbvpb3IC/video-707e55bb18_scruberthumbnail_1.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2013 18:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WPTavern: Easy Commerce With ShopLocket\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7148\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/ilP86x3hDsM/easy-commerce-with-shoplocket\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7359:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shoplocketlogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-7150\" alt=\"ShopLocket Logo\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shoplocketlogo.jpg?resize=151%2C39\" /></a>E-Commerce is hard, for both developers and end users. That&#8217;s why I was happy to see something like <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/shoplocket/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/shoplocket/\">ShopLocket</a> come across my inbox. <a href=\"https://www.shoplocket.com/\" title=\"https://www.shoplocket.com/\">ShopLocket</a> is perfect for those who have one, or just a few products to sell on their website. Instead of going through the process of installing an entire e-commerce system like WooCommerce, Shopp, or WP E-Commerce, you can use ShopLocket to create a product widget, embed it on a page and start selling.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started:</h2>\n<p>Connecting the plugin to the ShopLocket website was an easy process. In fact, unlike most other plugins, I didn&#8217;t have to enter an API key. I only had to authorize ShopLocket access to my website via a token. Once the two are connected, two things happen. A new button is added to the post/page writing panel called <strong>Add Product</strong> and a new <strong>ShopLocket widget</strong> is added to the list of available widgets. The add product button will add a shortcode within the post that will link to the product you choose.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shoplocketAddProductButton.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7153\" alt=\"ShopLocket Add Product Button\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shoplocketAddProductButton.jpg?resize=389%2C72\" /></a></p>\n<p>All of the product creation steps occur on the ShopLocket website. You start off by naming your product, giving it a price, providing a short description and then adding up to four product images. You can then select whether your product will be a digital file for download or if it will ship to customers. Then, if you would like to customize the product even more, there are the advanced options that enable you to add different variants of options such as Size, Color, etc. You can also charge a set tax, track the number of stock, shipping, expiration date, comparison price (in case it&#8217;s on sale) provide a custom landing page URL or accept pre-orders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ShopLocketProductEditing.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7154\" alt=\"ShopLocket Product Editing\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ShopLocketProductEditing.jpg?resize=339%2C500\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once all the product information is complete, the next step is to style the widget. Because this is a hosted service out of your control, you don&#8217;t have the ability to perfectly match up the widget to an existing design. However, between the six different styles, there should be one that fits. It would be nice if we could at least change the background colors or the button colors but it&#8217;s not a deal breaker. After you&#8217;ve chosen a design of your liking, the next step is to publish the product.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7155\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ShopLocketWidgetStyles.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7155\" alt=\"ShopLocket Widget Styles\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ShopLocketWidgetStyles.jpg?resize=308%2C500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">All 6 Styles</p></div>\n<p>After the product has been published, you&#8217;ll be provided an embed code to place the product anywhere on your site. Alternatively, you can <a title=\"https://www.shoplocket.com/products/7MZ9a-tavern-mug\" href=\"https://www.shoplocket.com/products/7MZ9a-tavern-mug\">link directly</a> to the product page on ShopLocket.com. The marketing wizard is composed of a sidebar with links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7157\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ShopLocketMarketingWizard.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7157\" alt=\"ShopLocket Marketing Wizard\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ShopLocketMarketingWizard.jpg?resize=192%2C300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marketing Wizard</p></div>\n<p>After the product is published, you&#8217;re ready to start taking orders. In order to process payments, ShopLocket supports Paypal and Stripe. If you don&#8217;t have either, you&#8217;ll be given an allotment of type to set up each account. Since ShopLocket is doing most of the hard work, they get paid 2.5% on any transaction you make. This is in addition to any Paypal or Stripe fees.</p>\n<p>One of the best aspects of ShopLocket is that buyers won&#8217;t have to add an item to a shopping cart and then go to a separate website to check-out. This keeps the buyer engaged and more likely to go through the entire check-out process.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Overall, my experience of creating and sharing products with ShopLocket was great. I think something like this is a huge deal for people who have a select amount of items to sell, without needing a catalog. Sure, you could go through the process of configuring a Paypal button specifically for a product but going through ShopLocket seems so much easier. Setting up an entire e-commerce system for just a few products doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to me when something like this exist. Another reason ShopLocket is a big deal is because of WordPress.com. WordPress.com has a strict assortment of widgets and to the best of my knowledge, there has never been a way to do anything involving e-commerce on WordPress.com websites.</p>\n<p>Back on March 28th of this year, <a title=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/shoplocket-blog-commerce/\" href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/shoplocket-blog-commerce/\">it was announced</a> WordPress VIP and Enterprise customers would be the first to get access to ShopLocket integration. At some point down the road, this service will be available to the regular WP.com customer base but it&#8217;s not clear whether it will be a paid upgrade or if it will be allowed for free across all sites. I&#8217;d be very surprised if WordPress.com didn&#8217;t charge for this as an upgrade. But considering how many talented people there is writing on WordPress.com, something like this could provide many with the ability to make some cash through physical or digital goods instead of having to rely on ads.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-review-woocommerce\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Plugin Review: WooCommerce\">Plugin Review: WooCommerce</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/shopp-releases-version-1-2-of-their-e-commerce-plugin\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Shopp Releases Version 1.2 Of Their E-Commerce Plugin\">Shopp Releases Version 1.2 Of Their E-Commerce Plugin</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/ilP86x3hDsM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2013 16:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WordPress.tv: Russell Aaron: Build Your Website Before You Install WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19360\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/30/russell-aaron-build-your-website-before-you-install-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:708:\"<div id=\"v-Y2AgR1a4-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19360/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19360/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19360&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/30/russell-aaron-build-your-website-before-you-install-wordpress/\"><img alt=\"Russell Aaron: Build Your Website Before You Install WordPress\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/Y2AgR1a4/video-a4dad7628b_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 May 2013 15:00:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: Post Formats UI Removed From WordPress 3.6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/cv8bBvfML4E/post-formats-ui-removed-from-wordpress-3-6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2432:\"<p>In what many will consider to be sad news, the Post Formats UI that so many people were looking forward to as part of WordPress 3.6 <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/\" title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/\">has been stripped from core</a>, for now.

Instead of delaying the release of WordPress 3.6 any longer, most of the work surrounding the Post Formats UI will exist as a plugin.

The main take away I have from his article is that plugin authors are under charging for the value that their plugins provide. But after reading the comments, I think most people are of the opinion that single site support licenses for plugins such as GravitfyForms are in a sweet spot but for the developer tier of licenses, they are severely under charging. </p>\n<p>As a consumer, I don&#8217;t want to see plugins like GravityForms bump up their single site licenses to $100 a month or $200 a year. I think plugin shops should definitely charge a premium for their developer license packages because the consultants are the ones making the big bucks and end up passing that cost onto their clients anyways. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/how-commercial-plugin-developers-are-monetizing-through-the-plugin-respository\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"How Commercial Plugin Developers Are Monetizing Through The Plugin Respository\">How Commercial Plugin Developers Are Monetizing Through The Plugin Respository</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/conversation-with-matt-martz\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Conversation With Matt Martz\">Conversation With Matt Martz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-repository-and-commercial-plugins\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Plugin Repository And Commercial Plugins\">Plugin Repository And Commercial Plugins</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/_aEzCrK3r4I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 May 2013 17:15:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: Summer Internship Projects Announced\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7128\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/rW5qtrLLsig/summer-internship-projects-announced\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5706:\"<p>Over the past few years, WordPress has made it a tradition to take part in the <a title=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\" href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer Of Code</a>.

Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I always think of the summer internship programs as a way for WordPress to scratch an itch. While the core team continues to work on the next version of WordPress, the interns get to work on the items that at times, are relegated to the bucket list. First off, I&#8217;m happy to see that someone has been assigned the task to create a Post By Email plugin to replace what exist in core. This is interesting because JetPack already has the ability to post by email. When I asked Jane Wells about this conundrum, <a title=\"https://twitter.com/wptavern/statuses/339752359901143041\" href=\"https://twitter.com/wptavern/statuses/339752359901143041\">this was her response</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because it&#8217;s still in core currently, and we don&#8217;t replace core functions with proprietary plugins, which Jetpack is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This makes sense as it wouldn&#8217;t be kosher to replace core functionality with a plugin that needs to be tied into WordPress.com to function.</p>\n<p>The other project that gets me somewhat excited is adding native WordPress revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. This has been a long time coming and is in alignment with Matt&#8217;s vision where users are unable to break their website or at the very least, are able to return it to normal at the click of a button. A part of me loves seeing revisions added to the plugin and theme editors but another part of me wonders why a code editor is within WordPress at all. In the early days of using WordPress, I used the code editor to make the necessary changes to theme files in order to add plugin functionality, as per the directions. But we&#8217;ve advanced so far from that, that I rarely ever use the code editor. I&#8217;m more inclined to use something like NotePad++. I conducted a non-scientific Twitter poll today asking my followers <em><a title=\"https://twitter.com/wptavern/statuses/339755891194740737\" href=\"https://twitter.com/wptavern/statuses/339755891194740737\">when is the last time you used the code editor in WP to edit a theme or plugin code?</a></em>. Turns out, there are definitely circumstances in which having a built-in editor is beneficial. For instance, when there is a lack of FTP access. It&#8217;s also a major convenience factor as it&#8217;s easier to edit a file from within a clients WordPress install than having to go through the process of gaining FTP credentials. After all, adding revisions to the editor is just another layer of protection that has very few, if any drawbacks.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that any of these projects will be completed or that the finished product will see the light of day. Do you see anything on the project list that you would love to see become a reality?</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a

title=\"https://github.com/10up/varying-vagrant-vagrants\">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> (VVV), which uses <a href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/\" title=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/\">Vagrant</a> and <a

the way back to the initial release, 0.71-gold.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve downloaded our fork of VVV and followed the setup instructions, you’ll be able to browse to http://wp-archive.local (which will be running off your local machine).</p>\n<p>All the major releases of WordPress have already been installed, and you can login with the username “admin” and the password “password”.

around the globe today, people are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the first WordPress release, affectionately known as #wp10. <a href=\"http://wp10.wordpress.net\">Watching the feed</a> of photos, tweets, and posts from Auckland to Zambia is incredible; from first-time bloggers to successful WordPress-based business owners, people are coming out in droves to raise a glass and share the &#8220;holiday&#8221; with their local communities. With hundreds of parties going on today, it&#8217;s more visible than ever just how popular WordPress has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who has ever contributed to this project: your labors of love made this day possible.</strong></p>\n<p>But today isn&#8217;t just about reflecting on how we got this far (though I thought <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\">Matt&#8217;s reflection on the first ten years</a> was lovely). We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=\"http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 May 2013 20:47:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Jen Mylo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Peter Westwood: Blog rebuilding …\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://westi.wordpress.com/?p=6388\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"http://westi.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/blog-rebuilding/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:835:\"<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve posted here and I feel like today is the special day when I should start trying to rebuild this blog, adding more content and giving it a lick of new paint.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve switched to Twenty Thirteen, and here is the first short post of hopefully more to come, for more about <a href=\"http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/\">my WordPress journey so far head over to my personal blog</a>.</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/westi.wordpress.com/6388/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/westi.wordpress.com/6388/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=westi.wordpress.com&blog=15396&post=6388&subd=westi&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 May 2013 17:52:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Peter Westwood\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Matt: Dear WordPress,\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=42431\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2424:\"<p>Has it really been 10 years? It seems just yesterday we were playing around on my blog, and the blogs of a few high school friends. Two of those friends are married, one isn&#8217;t anymore, two are still figuring things out, and one has passed away.</p>\n<p>You were cute before you became beautiful. Wearing black and white, afraid of color, trying to be so unassuming. I know you got jealous when I <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/niallkennedy/46279090/\">wore those Blogger t-shirts</a>. They were the cool kids at SxSW and I thought maybe you could grow up to be like them.</p>\n<p>You wouldn&#8217;t have shirts of your own for a few more years. We didn&#8217;t know what we were doing <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wordpressshirt/interesting/\">when we made them</a> and the logo printed ginormous. People called them the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryansking/112653220/\">Superman shirt</a> and made fun of them. But, oh, that logo &#8212; the curves fit you so well.</p>\n<p>You showed the world you were growing up, and how much you cared about design and typography and other platonic ideals. You knew that open source didn&#8217;t have to be homely. I stretched myself too thin trying to get you there, and I did a stupid thing to pay for it. I hurt you, but instead of casting me away you held me closer, supported me, gave me another chance. I will never forget that. Akismet made me feel less guilty. I wouldn&#8217;t change anything, because the mistake made me understand how important it is to fly straight and take your time.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re so beautiful&#8230; I&#8217;m continually amazed and delighted by how you&#8217;ve grown. Your awkward years are behind you. Best of all, through it all, you&#8217;ve stuck with the principles that got you started in the first place. You&#8217;re always changing but that never changes. You&#8217;re unafraid to try new things that may seem wacky or unpopular at first.</p>\n<p>I see you all over the world now, glowing from screens, bringing people together at meetups and <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org/\">WordCamps</a> &#8212; you&#8217;re at your best when you do that. You&#8217;re my muse; you inspire me, and I&#8217;ve seen you inspire others. You become a part of their life and they become a part of yours. I hope we grow old together.</p>\n<p>Cheers to ten years, and here&#8217;s to a hundred more.</p>\n<p>Love,<br

src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BasicCommentQuicktags.jpg?resize=187%2C83\" alt=\"Basic Comment Quicktags\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-7108\" /></a>There are very few instances when I&#8217;m browsing WPTavern.com without being logged in as an administrator. Turns out, I should do that more often as I discovered that my Comment Quicktags Reloaded plugin was broken. I&#8217;ve used Comment Quicktags Reloaded since launching WPTavern.com because I believe that comment forms are a lot like forum threads. Users should have the ability to bold words and use other tags while composing their comment, similar to how you would write a reply in a forum thread. CQR was developed by <a href=\"http://www.asymptomatic.net/\">Owen Winkler</a> who was an early WordPress enthusiast but has since gone on to be a part of <a href=\"https://habariproject.org/en/\">The Habari Project</a>. While the supported version of WordPress only went up to 2.2, the plugin continued to work way past that into the 3.0 branch. Thus began my search for an alternative.</p>\n<p>This brings me to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/basic-comment-quicktags/\">Basic Comment Quicktags</a> plugin authored by <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/ipstenu/\">Mika Epstein (Ipstenu)</a> and <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/marcdk/\">Marcdk</a> This plugin is very straight forward. Simply install it, turn it on via a checkbox in the Discussions page of WordPress and watch as the <strong>Bold, Italic, Link and Quote</strong> buttons appear above the comment form. If you&#8217;re wondering why more tags were not added, Mika explains:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After careful consideration, and a long review of my users, those are the only ones they ever use! If you have a reasonable argument why I should add in others, I&#8217;ll listen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While I don&#8217;t use bbPress just yet, I&#8217;m happy to report that Basic Comment Quicktags does have bbPress support built-in but not BuddyPress. While writing this article, I began to wonder why WordPress doesn&#8217;t ship with these tags above the comment form out of the box? I don&#8217;t have the answer but I did discover that the next best thing is knowing that a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API\">Quicktags API</a> was created and then added to WordPress 3.3. I think that this type of functionality should be part of every theme by default. I mean, why not? Shouldn&#8217;t users be able to easily compose comments with some of the bells and whistles that post authors have in the back-end of WordPress?</p>\n<p>But then, we run into the issue of whether it should be a theme option, or a stand alone plugin? Using a plugin, themes can be replaced without any loss of quicktag functionality. If it&#8217;s built into the theme, then when the theme goes, so do the quicktags. That&#8217;s a topic for debate but it&#8217;s nice to know that this type of simple functionality is built right into core so nobody has to worry about depending on one particular Quicktag plugin anymore. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/please-adopt-this-plugin-comment-quicktags-reloaded\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Please Adopt This Plugin &#8211; Comment Quicktags Reloaded\">Please Adopt This Plugin &#8211; Comment Quicktags Reloaded</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/basic-guide-on-creating-plugin-ui\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Basic Guide On Creating Plugin UI\">Basic Guide On Creating Plugin UI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/how-to-mimic-the-wptavern-commenting-system\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"How To Mimic The WPTavern Commenting System\">How To Mimic The WPTavern Commenting System</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/NCjbxU9QpLc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 24 May 2013 17:31:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WordPress Trivia For Your WordPress Birthday Party\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7104\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/5aB1moacBW0/wordpress-trivia-for-your-wordpress-birthday-party\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2881:\"<p>As we get closer to the 10th anniversary of WordPress, people have been asking me if I know of any WordPress trivia plugins or games that they could use for their 10th anniversary birthday party. While I don&#8217;t know of any plugins, there is a WordPress Jeopardy style website you can use that if nothing else, can help generate some trivia questions. It&#8217;s called <a href=\"http://www.wpgameshow.com/\" title=\"http://www.wpgameshow.com/\">WP Gameshow</a>. The concept was created by the organizers of WordCamp Detroit, 2011. When I originally <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-gameshow-now-available-to-play-from-home\">wrote about the site</a>, Anthony stated in the comments:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wpgameshow.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wpgameshow.png?resize=560%2C301\" alt=\"WordPress Game Show\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5884\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m glad everyone is enjoying the game! It was a lot of fun performing it live and we really would like to see what others can do with the platform. So yes, we do plan on releasing a theme which will allow for you to create your own questions and such. No time on release, but it is in the works.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To this day, nothing has been released although the domain is still active, complete with a game board. I got in touch with Anthony to see if he has made any progress on releasing this as a theme or plugin. </p>\n<blockquote><p>This is one of those things that we never finished for release. I just sent an email to my friend who I worked on it with for the most recent version. As soon as I hear back from him, I&#8217;m going to take another run at it and see if it&#8217;s &#8220;good enough&#8221; for use and we&#8217;ll try to post a copy of it for download on the trivia site.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you know as soon as I hear back from him and have the opportunity to put it up for release.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once I hear from  Anthony about a download link being established, I&#8217;ll pass the word along. Until then, you&#8217;ll have to use the actual WPGameshow website. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-trivia-winners\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress Trivia Winners\">WordPress Trivia Winners</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-gameshow-now-available-to-play-from-home\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress Gameshow Now Available To Play From Home\">WordPress Gameshow Now Available To Play From Home</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wptavern-trivia-game\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WPTavern Trivia Game\">WPTavern Trivia Game</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/5aB1moacBW0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 24 May 2013 14:49:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Automattic After-Market\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=42420\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/automattic-secondary/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4509:\"<p>One of the most striking shifts in entrepreneurship when I started <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> seven years ago was the rise of the Founder Friendly VCs. The standard operating procedure at the time for VC-backed companies consisted of bringing in &#8220;adult supervision,&#8221; founders often taking largely-ceremonial roles like &#8220;chief architect&#8221; after the business had scaled to a certain point, aggressive financial terms around liquidation preferences, and a control structure that more often than not left founders with a minority say in the future of the company, especially if it went through rough patches. Folks like <a href=\"http://www.trueventures.com/\">True Ventures</a> (who Automattic has always been intertwined with) appeared as iconoclasts because they came out saying that founders were the best ones to grow a company long-term and structuring their entire practice and way of investing around that idea. It seems non-controversial now, but it was like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Dylan_controversy\">Dylan going electric</a>. Still in spite of their philosophical innovations, many of these funds were structured in similar ways to the ones of old, with 7-10 year fund lifetimes, for example.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to 2013 and there&#8217;s an even more founder-friendly class of investors rising, at least for companies that have made it past a certain exit velocity of growth and revenue. Most visibly pioneered by <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/05/26/mark-zuckerberg-and-yuri-milner-talk-about-facebooks-new-investment-video/\">Yuri Milner and Facebook in 2009</a> there&#8217;s a breed of later-stage investors from largely financial backgrounds that come in with the ability to write checks larger than the <a href=\"http://www.nvca.org/index.php?Itemid=147\">entire size of most VC funds</a> and a desire to align with founders so strong that they embrace things that even VCs from the founder-friendly cohort would balk at: forgoing board seats, assigning voting proxies to founders, taking very long term approaches to growth, and investing in (and seeking out!) companies outside of the California/New York bubble, from South Africa to Russia to Brazil. The most interesting thing to me about this new generation is how behind the scenes they are: forget about a blog or Twitter, most of these guys don&#8217;t even have websites for their firms. These are some of the smartest and most successful people you&#8217;ll ever meet and you&#8217;ll never hear about them&#8230; they like it that way. Asymmetric information is their core competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>Anyway, wanted to get in front of the news that will inevitably come out in the next week or two: there has been a large secondary transaction in Automattic stock, about $50M worth. &#8220;Secondary&#8221; means that it&#8217;s existing stockholders, like the earliest investors or employees, selling stock to another investor versus money going into the company (&#8220;primary&#8221;). It was led by Lee Fixel at Tiger Global, one of the behind-the-scenes quiet geniuses that has previously invested in SurveyMonkey, Facebook, LinkedIn, Palantir, Square, Warby Parker&#8230; Automattic is healthy, generating cash, and already growing as fast as it can so there&#8217;s no need for the company to raise money directly &#8212; we&#8217;re not capital constrained. The minority of stockholders that elected to participate are holding on to the vast majority of their shares. We&#8217;re building an independent company that&#8217;s going to be a growing part of the fabric of the web for many years to come, so allowing early investors to lock in some returns releases any short-term pressure there might be on the company for a liquidity event and allows us to focus fully on the long road ahead.</p>\n<p>As sometimes happens in with regulated financial things, I can&#8217;t answer every question about this, but will leave comments open. I hope to see some of you on Monday the 27th when I&#8217;ll <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/\">be celebrating the 10th anniversary of WordPress alongside community members in over 500 cities</a>.

In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/is-it-time-to-refocus-the-dashboard-for-news\">I proposed the idea</a> of refocusing the dashboard so that it presented more WordPress Centric content. While some sites have been added and removed from the official Planet WordPress feed over the years, the core issue remains. It&#8217;s not as great of a source of WordPress information as it could be. I always thought that instead of having all the content from an individuals site published to the planet feed, it would have made much more sense to only subscribe to their WordPress category.</p>\n<h2>Alternatives:</h2>\n<p>Disappointed in the official planet feed, I searched for other resources of information and one day, came across a site called <a href=\"http://planetwordpress.planetozh.com/\">PlanetOzh</a>. PlanetOzh is just like Planet WordPress except it has more sites to aggregate content from and is maintained by Ozh. Sites are added and removed on a somewhat routine basis. However, I remember sending an email to Ozh one day after I went through each site he was aggregating content from and told him which ones I thought needed to be removed due to their lack of WordPress specific content or that the site appeared dead. It was a substantial list. From my observation, it looks like he has cleaned up the site so it&#8217;s much more relevant than it was a few years ago.</p>\n<p>Recently, the topic of the WordPress Planet was brought up again by <a href=\"http://wpmu.org/wordpress-planet-pants-problem/\">James Farmer of WPMU</a> where he does bring up some valid points. I&#8217;m of the opinion that the more people who see great WordPress centric information, the better off everyone in the WordPress ecosystem will be. So I&#8217;m all for making the WordPress Planet a better place. However, the official <a href=\"http://planet.wordpress.org/\">Planet WordPress</a> feed is maintained by one person, Matt Mullenweg. Considering just how busy he is, I can understand how maintaining the list of sites on the planet feed would be one of the last priorities on his list. I think some would agree that there are far more important things to be spending time and energy on with WordPress.org versus the planet feed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/betterplanetlogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7100\" alt=\"A Better Planet\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/betterplanetlogo.jpg?resize=408%2C207\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more variety of content from different WordPress centric websites in your dashboard, you should try the brand new plugin called <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/a-better-planet/\">A Better Planet</a> by <a href=\"http://wplift.com/a-better-planet\">WPLIft</a>. In a nutshell, this plugin is a more up-to-date and relevant version of the official planet WordPress feed. While the master list is controlled by one person, it looks like it&#8217;s a lot easier to have a WordPress site added to their list than the official feed.</p>\n<h2>Responsibility:</h2>\n<p>While I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing other WordPress centric sites in the dashboard supplying great information to users all across the world, I also wouldn&#8217;t want to see those same sites treating the dashboard as an enormous, untapped customer base. Being in the WordPress dashboard comes with great responsibility. For example, you have to be on-board with the 100% GPL philosophy. Sites can not link to other sites that promote non-GPL products. Sites can not advertise non-GPL products through display ads or otherwise. It really boils down to being an excellent steward in the community. There are WordPress centric sites that meet that criteria but I don&#8217;t make the decision on who is added to the feed and who is not.</p>\n<h2>Discussion Points:</h2>\n<p>So considering we&#8217;ve been having this conversation for a few years now, has anything really changed?

Unlike my struggles with the <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-wp-elasticsearch-plugin\">ElasticSearch Plugin</a>, the folks over at Swiftype couldn&#8217;t have made it any easier to get their plugin up and running.</p>\n<p>After signing up, I viewed their demo video which does a great job of explaining how to install and configure their WordPress plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\"></div>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://swiftype.com/pricing\">plans</a> range from Hobbyist at $19.00 per month to a Custom Enterprise solution. They don&#8217;t list what comes with the free account but you can find out that information after you sign up. The free account is perfect for small websites that have less than 2,000 articles. As I&#8217;ve learned in this process of reviewing search services, an article, post, or  page is called a document.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One search engine, 2 domains, 2,000 documents, and 50 query customizations. Recrawl once a week. Your search results must display Swiftype branding.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Swiftype doesn&#8217;t enable users to search by categories or dates. However, I&#8217;m beginning to think that if the search results are relevant enough, there isn&#8217;t a need to include those search queries. One of the cool things about Swiftype is that they give you access to manipulate the search results so that if they are not relevant enough, you can take a result and place it higher on the list.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7089\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ManipulateSearchResults.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7089\" alt=\"Manipulate Search Results\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ManipulateSearchResults.jpg?resize=539%2C257\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I can help make the results more relevant</p></div>\n<p>One of my favorite features is the drop-down suggested search results. In my experimental use, I&#8217;ve noticed that most of the time, the results of what I&#8217;m searching for end up in the suggested results drop down box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SuggestedSearches.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7090\" alt=\"Suggest Searches\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SuggestedSearches.jpg?resize=240%2C278\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are a few instances where the result I&#8217;m looking for is nowhere to be found. For example, if I search for <strong>WPWeekly Episode 10</strong> I see most of the episodes in the 100-110 range when I&#8217;m really looking for episode 10. When disabling the plugin, the search results are roughly equal. Both end up not returning the WPWeekly Episode 10 post as the first result. Using the search built into WordPress, I end up having to browse to the last page of search results to find the post I was looking for. With Swiftype, there is a huge improvement as the post shows up as the 13th result. It&#8217;s not number 1 but it&#8217;s not the last page of results either.</p>\n<p>If I wanted to, I could navigate to the Swiftype dashboard and manually move the results around so that episode 10 <strong>IS</strong> the first result. But, what I don&#8217;t understand is why episode 100-110 were displaying if my search string only contained two numbers? I love the ability to rearrange results but if I have to spend a lot of my time rearranging things, then Swiftype is not doing its job.</p>\n<p>There is one last small issue I had. For some reason, the drop down suggestion box didn&#8217;t work for every search query. For example, if I searched for the term <strong>jeopardy</strong> which I already know exist within the post content of an article, the suggestion box doesn&#8217;t show up but the article that contained the word jeopardy within the content ends up being the first result. I reached out to Swiftype to see if they could explain this behaviour to me and this is what they had to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Autocomplete suggestions are based on the post title, author name, and tags. Longer text fields like the post body and excerpt are used for full-text searches only (i.e., when the user submits a search). We have implemented it this way because the large volume of text in posts would make the autocomplete results less useful.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the fields we index in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://swiftype.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing_wordpress_search\">https://swiftype.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing_wordpress_search</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense to me. I also discovered that I misspelled jeopardy when I added it as a tag to the post. Once I fixed the tag, everything worked as it should.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Swiftype was a breeze to set up and within 10 minutes, I was able to improve the search results on my site. It only took that long because of the synchronization process. I&#8217;m going to stick with this plugin/service until I find something better but I come away from this experience being able to recommend Swiftype to those who want to substantially improve the built-in search functionality of WordPress. It&#8217;s also encouraging to know that on this journey I&#8217;ve been on, I&#8217;ve discovered that you don&#8217;t have to pay any money to improve the WordPress search.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-wp-elasticsearch-plugin\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Review Of WP-ElasticSearch Plugin\">Review Of WP-ElasticSearch Plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/improving-the-wordpress-search-engine-with-relevanssi\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi\">Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-review-spots-by-interconnectit\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Plugin Review &#8211; Spots By Interconnect/it\">Plugin Review &#8211; Spots By Interconnect/it</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/i4oANGpafnI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2013 16:53:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WordPress.tv: Russell Fair: “I Don’t Know Nothin’ ‘Bout Birthin’ Babies”, er, Child Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19169\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/23/russell-fair-i-dont-know-nothin-bout-birthin-babies-er-child-themes/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:758:\"<div id=\"v-VtACAncc-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19169/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19169/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19169&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/23/russell-fair-i-dont-know-nothin-bout-birthin-babies-er-child-themes/\"><img alt=\"Russell Fair: &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know Nothin&#8217; &#8216;Bout Birthin&#8217; Babies&#8221;, er, Child Themes\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/VtACAncc/video-64768b98f3_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2013 14:56:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"WPTavern: WordPress Nostalgia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7079\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/umlgyjF8rs8/wordpress-nostalgia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5412:\"<p>As we inch closer towards the 10 year anniversary of WordPress, I&#8217;ve been browsing through a few different time capsule posts. Some of them really tap into my nostalgic center while others have me asking questions such as, what ever happened to the Flock browser that WordPress was excited about in 2005? It was described as being just like FireFox but with goodies. If memory serves me right, it was supposed to be a social browser. At any rate, here is a collection of memory lane posts related to WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/down-memory-lane-with-wordpress-com\">Down Memory Lane With WordPress.com</a> &#8211; Although this was published in 2009, it gives a great overview of the history of the WordPress.com front page over the years.

It&#8217;s actually more difficult than you would think, especially for WordPress 0.7.1 which requires it&#8217;s own unique PHP.ini file. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/the-history-of-wordpress-default-themes\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The History Of WordPress Default Themes\">The History Of WordPress Default Themes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/post-format-history-and-wordpress-3-6\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Post Format History And WordPress 3.6\">Post Format History And WordPress 3.6</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/umlgyjF8rs8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 May 2013 19:35:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WordPress.tv: James Banks: Mobile First Development and Design for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19283\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/22/james-banks-mobile-first-development-and-design-for-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:702:\"<div id=\"v-1UpamxO7-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19283/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19283/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19283&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/22/james-banks-mobile-first-development-and-design-for-wordpress/\"><img alt=\"James Banks: Mobile First Development and Design for WordPress\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/1UpamxO7/video-7e4a6a670c_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 May 2013 13:22:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WPTavern: Help iThemes Help Their Neighbors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7073\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/OeENyG5J5qs/help-ithemes-help-their-neighbors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1148:\"<p>iThemes, the company behind products such as BackupBuddy and the Builder theme <a href=\"http://ithemes.com/2013/05/21/how-you-can-help-oklahoma/\">are reporting</a> that their headquarters as well as all of their staff are ok following the Tornadoes that ripped Moore, Oklahoma apart on May 20th.
